# MEQSAP Architectural Review - 2025-06-02

This document outlines architectural directives, new critical flaws, and strategic imperatives identified during the audit.

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-02

## Part 1A: Compliance Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates

### Previously Identified Critical Flaws - STATUS UPDATE

**✅ RESOLVED:** **Issue ID:** FLAW-20250601-001
**Category:** Architectural Degeneration (Violation of ADR-004 and memory.md)
**Location:** `src/meqsap/config.py` (local `ConfigError` definition), `src/meqsap/cli.py` (imports)
**Resolution Date:** 2025-06-02
**Resolution Summary:** The local `ConfigError` definition was removed from `src/meqsap/config.py`. The `src/meqsap/cli.py` module was verified to exclusively import and use `ConfigurationError` from `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`, adhering to ADR-004.

**✅ RESOLVED:** **Issue ID:** FLAW-20250601-002
**Category:** Documentation Misalignment (ADR/Policy vs. Implementation)
**Location:** `docs/adr/004-error-handling-policy.md`, `docs/policies/error-handling-policy.md`, `src/meqsap/cli.py`, `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`
**Resolution Date:** 2025-06-02
**Resolution Summary:** The exception hierarchy diagram in `docs/adr/004-error-handling-policy.md` and the "Exception Mapping" table in `docs/policies/error-handling-policy.md` were verified to include the CLI-specific exceptions (`DataAcquisitionError`, `BacktestExecutionError`, `ReportGenerationError`) as subclasses of `CLIError`, aligning documentation with the implemented error handling.

**✅ RESOLVED:** **Issue ID:** FLAW-20250601-003
**Category:** Documentation Inaccuracy (Architectural Diagram)
**Location:** `docs/architecture.md` (Project Structure diagram)
**Resolution Date:** 2025-06-02
**Resolution Summary:** The "Project Structure" diagram in `docs/architecture.md` was verified to include `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`, the `examples/` directory, and details of the `docs/` subdirectories (e.g., `adr/`, `policies/`), accurately reflecting the current project structure.

## Part 1B: New Critical Architectural Flaws

**-- REMAINING CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FLAW --**
**Issue ID:** FLAW-20250601-004
**Category:** Documentation Error (ADR Content Incorrect)
**Location:** `docs/adr/adr-002-date-range-handling.md` (Validation logic description)
**Description:** ADR-002 states that `data.py`'s validation logic for `end_date` inclusiveness is: `dates.max() < pd.Timestamp(end_date - timedelta(days=1))`. This logic is incorrect. If `end_date` is '2022-12-31', this checks if `dates.max()` is less than '2022-12-30', implying the last data point is '2022-12-29' or earlier, which contradicts the inclusive `end_date` goal. The actual implementation in `src/meqsap/data.py` correctly checks `if dates.max() < expected_end:`, where `expected_end` is the user-specified inclusive end date. The ADR documentation contains erroneous example validation logic.
**Consequences:** Developers referencing the ADR for implementing or verifying date handling might replicate the incorrect validation logic or misunderstand the correct implementation. This can lead to off-by-one errors in date range handling if the ADR's incorrect example is followed.
**Justification for Criticality:** ADRs are architectural decision records and must be accurate. An error in a critical ADR concerning data handling conventions can lead to data integrity issues or regressions.
**Root Cause Analysis:** A typographical or logical error was made when documenting the example validation logic in ADR-002.
**Systemic Prevention Mandate:**
1. Correct the example validation logic in `docs/adr/adr-002-date-range-handling.md`. The sentence "Validation logic accounts for this adjustment: `dates.max() < pd.Timestamp(end_date - timedelta(days=1))` verifies the last data point is for the user-specified end_date" should be revised to accurately reflect how to verify data for the inclusive `end_date` (e.g., "Validation logic ensures data for the inclusive `end_date` is present, such as `dates.max() >= pd.Timestamp(end_date)` after yfinance fetching and adjustment.").
2. Ensure all ADRs are peer-reviewed not just for the decision but also for the accuracy of any example code or logic provided within them.
3. When code implementing an ADR changes, the ADR itself must be reviewed for continued accuracy.

## Part 2: Strategic Architectural Imperatives

No new strategic architectural imperatives are proposed at this time. Focus should be on rectifying the remaining critical flaw identified in Part 1B (FLAW-20250601-004).

## Part 3: Actionable Technical Debt Rectification

Refer to `technical_debt.md` for new and updated technical debt items logged during this audit.

## Part 4: Audit Conclusion & Next Steps Mandate

1.  **Critical Path to Compliance:**
    * **Remaining Priority:** Resolve FLAW-20250601-004 (ADR-002 Incorrect Validation Logic). This involves a direct error in ADR documentation that could lead to implementation mistakes.
    * **Progress Update:** Successfully resolved 3 of 4 critical architectural flaws identified in the previous audit cycle:
      - ✅ FLAW-20250601-001: Duplicate ConfigError resolved
      - ✅ FLAW-20250601-002: CLI exception documentation alignment resolved  
      - ✅ FLAW-20250601-003: Architecture diagram accuracy resolved
      - ❌ FLAW-20250601-004: ADR-002 validation logic error remains unresolved
2.  **System Integrity Verdict:** The system's architectural integrity is **SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED**. Three of four critical architectural flaws have been successfully resolved, demonstrating effective adherence to established architectural principles. The remaining flaw (FLAW-20250601-004) is a documentation error that does not affect runtime behavior but requires correction to maintain ADR accuracy and prevent future implementation mistakes.
3.  **`arch_review.md` Update Instruction:** The resolved issues from this cycle have been moved to Part 1A for tracking. Only FLAW-20250601-004 remains as an active critical flaw requiring resolution.
4.  **`resolved_issues.md` Maintenance Confirmation:** `resolved_issues.md` has been updated with three resolved issues (FLAW-20250601-001, FLAW-20250601-002, FLAW-20250601-003) all resolved on 2025-06-02. No issues were re-opened from the previous cycle.
