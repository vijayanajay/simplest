# Coding Standards for Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System

## Overview

This document establishes guidelines for code quality, consistency, and maintainability to ensure the codebase is readable, scalable, and collaborative.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 for Python code. Use tools like Black for auto-formatting and Flake8 for linting.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case for variables and functions (e.g., feature_factory). Classes should be CamelCase (e.g., StrategyOptimizer).
- **Comments and Documentation**: Use docstrings for all functions and classes. Keep comments concise and focused on explaining why, not what.
- **Version Control**: Commit atomic changes with descriptive messages. Use branches for features and pull requests for reviews.

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks for anticipated errors, and log exceptions appropriately.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all modules; aim for 80% coverage.
- **Security**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data; use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Performance**: Optimize code for financial computations, using vectorized operations in NumPy where possible.

## Tools and Enforcement

- **Linters**: Integrate Flake8 and Pylint into the CI pipeline.
- **Formatters**: Enforce Black for consistent formatting.
