# Technology Stack for Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System

## Overview

This document outlines the key technologies, libraries, and tools used in the system to ensure modularity, efficiency, and maintainability.

## Primary Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+ (for its extensive ecosystem in data analysis and machine learning).
- **Data Fetching**: yfinance library for retrieving historical OHLCV data from NSE equity stocks, with local caching to minimize API calls.
- **Data Analysis and Indicators**: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and TA-Lib for technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ATR.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) for implementing the GA engine, including population management, selection, crossover, and mutation.
- **Backtesting**: Backtrader or Zipline for simulating strategy performance, incorporating transaction costs, slippage, and position sizing.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating charts, Mermaid for diagrams, and Markdown for documentation.

## Libraries and Dependencies

- **Core Libraries**:
  - pandas==2.0.0
  - numpy==1.24.0
  - yfinance==0.2.18
  - deap==1.3.1
  - backtrader==1.9.76.123 (or equivalent)
  - ta-lib==0.4.24

- **Utilities**:
  - yaml for configuration file handling.
  - logging for application logging and error tracking.

## Infrastructure and Tools

- **Development Environment**: VS Code or PyCharm on Windows, with virtual environments managed by venv or conda.
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management.
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Deployment**: Local execution; no cloud dependencies for MVP, but could extend to AWS or Azure for scalability.

## Rationale for Choices

- Selected for their maturity, community support, and suitability for financial data processing.
- Emphasis on open-source tools to keep the system lightweight and cost-effective.
