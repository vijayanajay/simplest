## 3. Rationale for Key Choices

-   **Python Ecosystem:** The choice of Python and its associated data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib) is driven by the project's nature involving financial data analysis, algorithmic processing, and the need for rapid prototyping and iteration.
-   **Modularity and Maintainability:** Tools like Poetry, Pydantic, MyPy, and a strong emphasis on testing (Pytest) are chosen to enhance code quality, maintainability, and make collaboration (including with AI agents) more effective.
-   **Automation:** GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks are selected to automate quality checks and ensure consistency.
-   **User Experience (CLI):** Typer is chosen for its modern approach to building user-friendly CLIs with good validation and help generation.
-   **Flexibility vs. Off-the-Shelf:** For core components like the GA and Backtester, the PRD indicates a preference for either well-regarded libraries (DEAP, Backtrader) or custom implementations if more control is needed. The tech stack reflects this by listing them as options, with the final decision to be based on detailed implementation needs.
-   **Support for spike planning:** Select tools that facilitate rapid prototyping and validation in high-risk areas, ensuring modularity and ease of testing.
