# Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Intro

The Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System is a Python-based solution designed to autonomously discover, evaluate, and evolve short-term trading strategies specifically tailored for NSE equity stocks. The system leverages genetic algorithms, heuristic analysis, and robust backtesting to iteratively refine strategies, minimizing manual intervention and maximizing interpretability. This MVP aims to provide retail traders and analysts with a transparent, automated, and adaptive tool to systematically identify profitable trading strategies without manual rule-writing.

## Goals and Context

- **Project Objectives:**
  - Automate the discovery and evolution of profitable short-term trading strategies for NSE equities.
  - Provide clear, interpretable strategies that evolve based on historical performance and heuristic feedback.
  - Enable analysts to easily review and validate strategy evolution through concise, human-readable reports.
  - Ensure strategies are robust, generalizable, and avoid overfitting to historical data.

- **Measurable Outcomes:**
  - Reduction in manual effort required for strategy discovery and refinement.
  - Improvement in strategy performance metrics (net profit, Sharpe ratio, win rate) compared to baseline strategies.
  - Increased analyst confidence in automated strategy evolution through clear reporting and transparency.

- **Success Criteria:**
  - System autonomously generates and evolves strategies that outperform simple baseline strategies.
  - Analysts can clearly understand strategy logic, evolution rationale, and heuristic adjustments from generated reports.
  - Strategies demonstrate robustness across multiple market conditions and stocks.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - Net profit and Sharpe ratio improvements over baseline.
  - Strategy robustness (performance consistency across market regimes).
  - Analyst satisfaction and ease-of-use ratings.

## Scope and Requirements (MVP / Current Version)

### Functional Requirements (High-Level)

- **Capability 1: Automated Feature Generation**
  - Automatically fetch NSE equity data via `yfinance`.
  - Generate standard technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, volume indicators).

- **Capability 2: Strategy Backtesting**
  - Evaluate strategies defined by simple JSON-like rules.
  - Calculate key performance metrics (profit, Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown).
  - Provide concise visualizations (equity curves, trade signals).

- **Capability 3: Genetic Algorithm-Based Strategy Optimization**
  - Automatically generate initial simple strategies.
  - Evolve strategies using genetic operations (crossover, mutation, selection).
  - Implement heuristic tagging, archetype clustering, Bayesian updates, and evolutionary fitness shaping.

- **Capability 4: Analyst Reporting and Heuristic Analysis**
  - Generate concise, human-readable analyst reports summarizing strategy performance, heuristic tags, adjustments, and robustness tests.
  - Perform heuristic tagging (root cause analysis), archetype clustering, and adversarial simulations.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** Efficient backtesting and optimization suitable for local Windows PC execution.
- **Scalability:** Modular design allowing future enhancements and integration.
- **Reliability/Availability:** Robust error handling and clear logging for debugging.
- **Security:** Local execution; minimal security concerns for MVP.
- **Maintainability:** Clear, modular Python code with comprehensive documentation and unit tests.
- **Usability/Accessibility:** Clear, intuitive analyst reports; minimal technical expertise required.
- **Other Constraints:** Python-only implementation, exclusive use of `yfinance` for data sourcing.

### User Experience (UX) Requirements (High-Level)

- **UX Goal 1:** Analysts can quickly understand strategy logic, performance, and evolution rationale from concise reports.
- **UX Goal 2:** Minimal setup and configuration required; intuitive command-line or script-based interaction.

_(See `docs/ui-ux-spec.md` for details)_

### Integration Requirements (High-Level)

- **Integration Point 1:** `yfinance` API for historical NSE equity data retrieval.
- **Integration Point 2:** Future integration with Zerodha API (post-MVP).

_(See `docs/api-reference.md` for technical details)_

### Testing Requirements (High-Level)

- Comprehensive unit tests for each Python package.
- Integration tests validating interactions between packages.
- Specific robustness testing across diverse market regimes.

## Initial Architect Prompt

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Starter Project/Template:** Python-based modular package structure; standard Python packaging (`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`).
- **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** Local Windows PC execution; no cloud hosting required for MVP.
- **Frontend Platform:** Not applicable; command-line or script-based interaction.
- **Backend Platform:** Python exclusively; modular packages (`FeatureFactory`, `StrategyBacktester`, `StrategyOptimizer`, `StrategyAnalyzer`).
- **Database Requirements:** No database required; local CSV or Pandas DataFrames sufficient for MVP.

### Technical Constraints
