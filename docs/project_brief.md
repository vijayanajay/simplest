# Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Intro

The Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System is a Python-based solution designed to autonomously discover, evaluate, and evolve short-term trading strategies specifically tailored for NSE equity stocks. The system leverages genetic algorithms, heuristic analysis, and robust backtesting to iteratively refine strategies, minimizing manual intervention and maximizing interpretability. This MVP aims to provide retail traders and analysts with a transparent, automated, and adaptive tool to systematically identify profitable trading strategies without manual rule-writing.

## Goals and Context

- **Project Objectives:**
  - Automate the discovery and evolution of profitable short-term trading strategies for NSE equities.
  - Provide clear, interpretable strategies that evolve based on historical performance and heuristic feedback.
  - Enable analysts to easily review and validate strategy evolution through concise, human-readable reports.
  - Ensure strategies are robust, generalizable, and avoid overfitting to historical data.

- **Measurable Outcomes:**
  - Reduction in manual effort required for strategy discovery and refinement.
  - **Completion of dedicated spike/prototyping phases for high-risk algorithmic components (realistic backtesting, multi-stock GA fitness/heuristics) with documented findings.**
  - **Creation of clear, step-by-step initial project setup documentation and a user-facing basic usage guide.**
  - Improvement in strategy performance metrics (net profit, Sharpe ratio, win rate) compared to baseline strategies.
  - Increased analyst confidence in automated strategy evolution through clear reporting and transparency.

- **Success Criteria:**
  - System autonomously generates and evolves strategies that outperform simple baseline strategies.
  - Analysts can clearly understand strategy logic, evolution rationale, and heuristic adjustments from generated reports.
  - Spikes/prototypes for core algorithms successfully validate implementation approaches and de-risk development.
  - Strategies demonstrate robustness across multiple market conditions and stocks.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - Net profit and Sharpe ratio improvements over baseline.
  - Strategy robustness (performance consistency across market regimes).
  - Analyst satisfaction and ease-of-use ratings.

## Scope and Requirements (MVP / Current Version)

### Functional Requirements (High-Level)

  - **Spike:** Conduct dedicated spike on implementing realistic costs, slippage, and basic position sizing, focusing on multi-stock backtest aggregation performance.
  - Evaluate strategies defined by simple JSON-like rules.
  - Calculate key performance metrics (profit, Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown), including costs and sizing, aggregated across multiple stocks.
  - Calculate key performance metrics (profit, Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown).
  - Provide concise visualizations (equity curves, trade signals).

- **Capability 3: Genetic Algorithm-Based Strategy Optimization**
  - Automatically generate initial simple strategies.
  - Evolve strategies using genetic operations (crossover, mutation, selection).
  - **Spike:** Conduct dedicated spike on implementing the multi-stock fitness function and core heuristic integration (e.g., penalizing `GloballyPoorPerformer`, `PoorGeneralization`).
  - Implement heuristic tagging, archetype clustering, Bayesian updates, and evolutionary fitness shaping.
  - **Implement core GA mechanics based on spike findings.**

- **Capability 4: Reporting and Analysis**
  - Generate concise, human-readable analyst reports summarizing strategy performance, heuristic tags, adjustments, and robustness tests.
  - Perform heuristic tagging (root cause analysis), archetype clustering, and adversarial simulations.

### User Experience (UX) Requirements (High-Level)

- **UX Goal 1:** Analysts can quickly understand strategy logic, performance, and evolution rationale from concise reports.
- **UX Goal 2:** Minimal setup and configuration required; intuitive command-line or script-based interaction.
- **User Documentation:** Create a clear, step-by-step guide for initial project setup and basic user operation (running a discovery run, interpreting reports).
