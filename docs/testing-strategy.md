# Testing Strategy for Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and robustness of the system, including unit tests, integration tests, and backtesting validations.

## Testing Components

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual modules like FeatureFactory and StrategyOptimizer using Pytest, focusing on edge cases and parameter variations.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components, such as data flow from FeatureFactory to StrategyOptimizer.
- **Backtesting Validation**: Simulate historical trades to validate strategy performance metrics, including stress tests with varied market conditions.
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage, with automated checks via coverage.py.

## Testing Tools and Process

- **Tools**: Pytest for test execution, Mock for dependencies, and coverage.py for reporting.
- **Process**: Run tests in a CI/CD pipeline; manual reviews for backtesting results.

## Rationale

- Comprehensive testing prevents errors in financial computations and ensures strategy reliability.
