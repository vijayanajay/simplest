# Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System Testing Strategy

## 1. Overall Philosophy & Goals

The testing strategy for the Adaptive Automated Trading Strategy Discovery System aims to ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the application. We will follow a multi-layered approach, emphasizing automation at all levels to enable confident development, refactoring, and continuous integration.

-   **Core Philosophy:** "Test early, test often, test automatically." We aim for a high degree of confidence in each component and the system as a whole.
-   **Goal 1: High Code Coverage for Critical Modules:** Achieve at least 85% unit test coverage for core logic in components like feature engineering, GA, backtesting, and data validation.
-   **Goal 2: Prevent Regressions:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality through comprehensive automated test suites run in CI.
-   **Goal 3: Validate Correctness of Algorithms:** Verify that the financial calculations, GA operations, and backtesting mechanics are implemented correctly against known examples or theoretical behavior.
-   **Goal 4: Ensure Reproducibility:** Tests will be designed to confirm that, given the same inputs and configuration (and random seeds where applicable), the system produces consistent outputs. (PRD Testing Requirements)
-   **Goal 5: Validate Strategy Robustness:** Employ specific testing methodologies to assess the generalizability and robustness of discovered strategies. (PRD Testing Requirements)

## 2. Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

-   **Scope:** Test individual functions, methods, classes, or small, cohesive pieces of logic in isolation. Focus on business logic, calculations, conditional paths, and boundary conditions within a single module.
    *   Examples: Testing a specific technical indicator calculation, a single genetic operator, a Pydantic model validation, a utility function.
-   **Tools:**
    *   Framework: `Pytest`
    *   Mocking/Stubbing: `unittest.mock` (Python's built-in) or `pytest-mock` plugin.
-   **Location:** `tests/unit/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure (e.g., `tests/unit/components/test_feature_factory.py`).
-   **Expectations:**
    *   Cover all significant logic paths and edge cases within a unit.
    *   Fast execution (milliseconds per test).
    *   No external dependencies (network, file system I/O, databases are mocked).
    *   Form the largest portion of the automated tests.

### Integration Tests

-   **Scope:** Verify the interaction and collaboration between multiple internal components or modules. Test the flow of data and control within a specific feature or workflow slice. May involve limited, controlled interaction with file systems (using temporary files/directories) or in-memory databases (e.g., in-memory SQLite for cache testing).
    *   Examples: Testing the flow from data fetching through feature calculation for a single stock, testing the GA's interaction with the fitness evaluation (backtester stub), testing configuration loading and its effect on component initialization.
-   **Tools:**
    *   Framework: `Pytest`
    *   Mocking: Mock external APIs (like `yfinance`) or services not under test.
    *   Test Data: Use small, well-defined test data sets.
-   **Location:** `tests/integration/` directory.
-   **Expectations:**
    *   Focus on the contracts and interfaces between components.
    *   Slower than unit tests but faster than E2E tests.
    *   Run frequently in CI.

### End-to-End (E2E) / Acceptance Tests

-   **Scope:** Test the entire system flow from a user's perspective, interacting with the application through its primary external interface (the CLI). Validate complete user journeys or business processes against a near-production setup (using real or realistic configurations and sample data).
    *   Examples: Running the `tradefinder discover` command with a sample `config.yaml`, verifying that reports are generated correctly, checking log outputs, validating GA checkpointing and resumption.
-   **Tools:**
    *   Framework: `Pytest` combined with `subprocess` module to invoke CLI commands.
    *   Assertions: Check exit codes, stdout/stderr, generated files (reports, logs, checkpoints), and content of these files.
-   **Environment:** Run against a locally composed setup that mimics the user environment. May use a dedicated test configuration file.
-   **Location:** `tests/e2e/` directory, with subdirectories for test data if needed (e.g., `tests/e2e/test_data/sample_config.yaml`).
-   **Expectations:**
    *   Cover critical user paths and core functionalities.
    *   Slower and potentially more brittle than unit/integration tests.
    *   Run as part of CI, but perhaps less frequently on every commit if very time-consuming (e.g., run on PRs and merges to main).

### Manual / Exploratory Testing

-   **Scope:** While automation is prioritized, some manual testing will be necessary, especially for:
    *   Exploratory testing of new features or complex interactions.
    *   Usability testing of CLI outputs and reports.
    *   Investigating issues found by automated tests or reported by users.
    *   Testing on different Windows environments if issues are suspected.
-   **Process:** Document findings from exploratory testing. If bugs are found, create corresponding automated tests to prevent regressions.

## 3. Specialized Testing Types (as per PRD)

### Reproducibility Testing

-   **Scope & Goals:** Verify that given the same `config.yaml` (including random seeds for GA and any other stochastic processes) and the same input data, the system produces identical or statistically indistinguishable results (e.g., same top strategies, similar backtest metrics).
-   **Methodology:**
    *   Run the system multiple times with fixed seeds and configurations.
    *   Compare key outputs: generated strategy rules, backtest metrics, GA evolution logs.
    *   Automate this as an E2E test where feasible.
-   **Tools:** `Pytest`, file comparison utilities, statistical checks if minor floating-point variations are expected.

### Baseline Strategy Tests

-   **Scope & Goals:** Evaluate the GA's ability to outperform (or at least match) simple, well-known baseline strategies (e.g., Buy and Hold, simple Moving Average Crossover).
-   **Methodology:**
    *   Implement baseline strategies.
    *   Run the GA and compare its best-evolved strategies against these baselines on the same dataset and backtesting conditions.
    *   This is more of a validation methodology than a strict test, but results should be logged and reviewed.
-   **Tools:** Comparison scripts, reporting.

### Robustness & Validation Testing Methodology (PRD Inspired)

-   **Multi-Stock Validation:**
    *   **Scope:** Ensure strategies evolved on one set of stocks (or a single stock) can generalize to other, unseen stocks (within the same market segment, e.g., large-cap NSE).
    *   **Methodology:** Evolve strategies on a training set of symbols. Evaluate top strategies on a hold-out/test set of different symbols.
-   **Out-of-Sample Testing (Temporal):**
    *   **Scope:** Standard financial practice. Train/evolve strategies on one time period, test on a subsequent, unseen time period.
    *   **Methodology:** Split historical data into training and testing periods.
-   **Adversarial Simulation / Stress Testing (Conceptual for MVP):**
    *   **Scope:** Test strategy performance during different market regimes (e.g., high volatility, crashes, bull/bear markets). (PRD)
    *   **Methodology (MVP):** Manually select historical data segments representing these regimes and backtest top strategies on them. Log and analyze performance. (Future: Could involve synthetic data or scenario generation).
-   **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis (Conceptual for MVP):**
    *   **Scope:** Understand how sensitive a strategy's performance is to small changes in its parameters.
    *   **Methodology (MVP):** For top strategies, manually vary key parameters slightly and observe the impact on backtest results.

### Performance Testing & Profiling

-   **Scope & Goals:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks in data processing, GA evolution, and backtesting. Ensure the system runs within acceptable timeframes for typical use cases. (PRD NFRs)
-   **Methodology:**
    *   Use Python's built-in `cProfile` and `pstats` for profiling code sections.
    *   Line profilers (e.g., `line_profiler`) for more granular analysis.
    *   Memory profilers (e.g., `memory_profiler`) to check for memory leaks or excessive usage.
    *   Benchmark critical operations.
-   **Tools:** `cProfile`, `pstats`, `line_profiler`, `memory_profiler`, `pytest-benchmark`.

### Security Testing (Basic for MVP)

-   **Scope & Goals:** Identify basic security vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (PRD NFRs)
    *   Input Validation: Ensure configuration files and CLI inputs are validated to prevent unexpected behavior (covered by Pydantic and Typer usage).
-   **Tools:** `safety` (via Poetry plugin or standalone), GitHub Dependabot.

## 4. Test Data Management

-   **Unit Tests:** Use hardcoded mock data or small, self-contained data structures created within the test functions.
-   **Integration Tests:** Use small, curated sample data files (e.g., short CSVs of stock data) stored in `tests/integration/test_data/`. These should be committed to the repository.
-   **E2E Tests:** Use example `config.yaml` files and potentially slightly larger (but still manageable) sample data sets stored in `tests/e2e/test_data/`.
-   **Data for Robustness Testing:** Scripts might be needed to prepare specific datasets (e.g., selecting data for different market regimes from a larger historical dataset). These datasets themselves might not be committed if large, but the scripts to generate/select them should be.
-   **Cache Handling:** Tests that interact with the caching mechanism should ensure the cache is in a known state before the test (e.g., cleared or pre-populated) and cleaned up afterward if necessary. Pytest fixtures can manage this.

## 5. CI/CD Integration

-   **Tool:** GitHub Actions (as defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`).
-   **Triggers:** Tests will run on every push to any branch and on every pull request against the `main` (or `develop`) branch.
-   **Pipeline Steps:**
    1.  Checkout code.
    2.  Set up Python environment (using Poetry).
    3.  Install dependencies.
    4.  Run linters (Flake8) and formatters (Black, isort --check mode).
    5.  Run static type checker (MyPy).
    6.  Run unit tests (Pytest).
    7.  Run integration tests (Pytest).
    8.  Run E2E tests (Pytest).
    9.  Calculate and report code coverage (`pytest-cov`).
-   **Failure Policy:** A failure in any step (linting, formatting, type checking, any test level) will cause the CI pipeline to fail, blocking merges of pull requests until fixed.
-   **Coverage Threshold:** Enforce a minimum code coverage percentage. If coverage drops below the threshold, the build fails.
