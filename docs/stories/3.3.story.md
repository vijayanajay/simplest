# Story 3.3: Multi-Stock Fitness Function

**Epic:** 3: GA Strategy Optimizer
**Goal:** Implement the core fitness function for the GA that evaluates strategies based on their performance across multiple stocks.

## Requirements

*   Implement a fitness function that takes a `TradingStrategy` individual and the historical data for *all* target stocks specified in the configuration.
*   For each stock, run the `StrategyBacktester` to get `BacktestMetrics`.
*   Combine the per-stock `BacktestMetrics` into a single fitness score. The fitness function must incorporate performance across multiple (e.g., 2-3 configurable) diverse stocks, penalizing single-stock wonders, as per PRD.
*   The specific fitness calculation logic (e.g., average Sharpe Ratio across profitable stocks, minimum Sharpe Ratio across a subset, weighted sum of metrics) should be defined and implemented.
*   Integrate the fitness function into the GA evaluation loop.
*   Add unit tests for the fitness function using predefined per-stock backtest results to verify the aggregation logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   A fitness function is implemented that accepts a strategy and multi-stock data.
*   The fitness function calls the `StrategyBacktester` for each relevant stock.
*   The fitness score is calculated based on performance across multiple stocks, penalizing strategies that only work on one stock.
*   The fitness function is used by the GA to evaluate individuals.
*   Unit tests verify the multi-stock aggregation logic of the fitness function.

## Tasks

1.  Define the specific multi-stock fitness calculation logic (e.g., average Sharpe Ratio of stocks where Net Profit > 0, or a weighted sum of metrics across all stocks). Document this logic.
2.  Implement the fitness function in `strategy_optimizer.py` that orchestrates backtesting on multiple stocks and calculates the aggregate fitness score.
3.  Ensure the fitness function correctly handles cases where a strategy fails completely on some stocks.
4.  Integrate the fitness function into the GA's evaluation step.
5.  Update `GAConfig` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include parameters related to the fitness function (e.g., `min_profitable_stocks`, weights for metrics).
6.  Add unit tests for the fitness function, providing mock `BacktestMetrics` for multiple stocks and verifying the calculated aggregate fitness.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_optimizer.py`. Interacts with `strategy_backtester.py`. Update config.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, potentially DEAP or NumPy.
*   **Data Models:** Uses `TradingStrategy`, `BacktestMetrics`, `GAConfig` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`, mocking backtester calls or using predefined results. Focus on the multi-stock aggregation logic.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 3 (GA - fitness function must incorporate multi-stock performance), Goals and Objectives (Identify strategies that generalize well), Success Criteria (outperform on a basket), KPIs (Net Profit/Sharpe Improvement averaged across N stocks, Robustness & Generalizability).
