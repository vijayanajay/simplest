# User Story 3.3: Generate and Review Reports

## Description
As a quantitative trader, I want the system to generate comprehensive reports on the evolved and backtested strategies so that I can review performance metrics, visualize results, and make informed decisions for live trading.

## Requirements
- Use the reporting configuration from `config.yaml`, including output directory, report formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown, CSV), and settings for top N strategies.
- Compile data from `BacktestMetrics`, `GAEvolutionLogEntry`, and `ReportData` models to create reports summarizing GA evolution, strategy details, and key KPIs like Sharpe ratio and total net profit.
- Include visualizations such as equity curves, trade histograms, and performance charts, generated from trade data in the `trades` list of `BacktestMetrics`.
- Ensure reports are saved in the specified formats and directories, with options for including GA logs and strategy snapshots.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reports are generated for the top strategies based on fitness scores, including all relevant metrics from the `BacktestMetrics` model.
- Validate report data against Pydantic schemas to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Output files match the specified formats, and the report includes summaries, detailed strategy analyses, and any error logs from the GA or backtesting processes.
- Testing: Verify report generation by checking file outputs and ensuring data integrity through unit tests on report compilation logic.

## Technical Context
- Implement reporting using libraries like Pandas for data aggregation, Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations, and Jinja2 for templating HTML/Markdown reports.
- Integrate with the database schemas for pulling cached data if needed, and ensure compatibility with the overall system configuration for seamless export.
