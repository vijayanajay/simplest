# Story 3.5: GA State Management & Logging

**Epic:** 3: GA Strategy Optimizer
**Goal:** Implement robust checkpointing for the GA state and structured logging of GA evolution metrics.

## Requirements

*   Implement a mechanism to save the current state of the Genetic Algorithm (population, generation number, random state, hall of fame, etc.) to a file periodically.
*   The checkpointing interval and path template should be configurable via `config.yaml`.
*   Implement logic to resume a GA run from a saved checkpoint file.
*   Implement structured logging for key GA evolution metrics (`GAEvolutionLogEntry`) at the end of each generation.
*   Log metrics such as generation number, timestamp, best fitness, average fitness, population size, best individual ID, and potentially diversity metrics.
*   Log output should be in JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) format to a file specified in `config.yaml`.
*   Add unit tests for checkpointing (saving and loading) and logging format/content.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   GA state can be saved to a file at configurable intervals.
*   A GA run can be resumed from a previously saved checkpoint.
*   GA evolution metrics are logged in JSON Lines format at the end of each generation.
*   The log file contains entries with the structure defined by `GAEvolutionLogEntry`.
*   Unit tests verify checkpoint saving/loading and log entry format/content.

## Tasks

1.  Define `GAEvolutionLogEntry` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py`.
2.  Update `GAConfig` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include `checkpoint_interval`, `checkpoint_path_template`, and `evolution_log_path`.
3.  Implement checkpoint saving logic within the GA loop, using `pickle` or a suitable format, saving the necessary state variables.
4.  Implement checkpoint loading logic at the start of the GA run if a checkpoint file is specified.
5.  Implement logging logic within the GA loop to create and write `GAEvolutionLogEntry` objects to the specified JSON Lines file. Use the structured logging setup from Story 1.1.
6.  Add unit tests for saving and loading checkpoints (mocking file I/O if necessary).
7.  Add unit tests for the GA evolution logging, verifying the format and content of log entries.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_optimizer.py`. Checkpoints go in `state/ga_checkpoints/`. Log file goes in the reports directory or a specified log directory. Update config and data models.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, `pickle` (or HDF5/Parquet if preferred for state), `json`, `logging`.
*   **Data Models:** Use `GAEvolutionLogEntry`, `GAConfig` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings. Use structured logging. Be mindful of security implications if using `pickle` with untrusted sources (ensure checkpoints are only from internal runs).
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on persistence and logging format.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 3 (GA State Management, Log key GA evolution metrics), NFRs (Reliability - Structured logging, Centralized log output, Log key GA metrics, Reproducibility - from checkpoint).
