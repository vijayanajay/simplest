# User Story 4.4: Strategy Ledger (MVP)

## Description
As an analyst, I want a documented list of all tested strategies (Strategy Ledger), their performance, and failure rates on a per-stock basis, highlighting strategies deemed broadly ineffective, so that I have a comprehensive record of the discovery run.

## Requirements
- Implement generation of the "Strategy Ledger" within StrategyAnalyzer.
- The ledger should be a simple CSV or log file.
- It must list all unique strategy structures tested during the run.
- For each strategy, include a summary of its performance and failure status (e.g., tags applied, key metrics) for each stock it was tested on.
- Include a flag or indicator for strategies tagged as GloballyPoorPerformer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC1: The StrategyAnalyzer generates a "Strategy Ledger" file (CSV or log).
- AC2: The ledger lists all unique strategy structures tested.
- AC3: For each strategy, the ledger includes a summary of its performance/failure status per stock tested.
- AC4: The ledger includes an indicator for strategies tagged as GloballyPoorPerformer.

## Tasks
- Collect all unique strategies and their per-stock results.
- Format data for CSV/log output.
- Write ledger file.
