# Story 4.4: Report Visualizations

**Epic:** 4: Analysis & Reporting
**Goal:** Integrate plotting libraries to generate visualizations (equity curves, trade plots) for the reports.

## Requirements

*   Integrate Matplotlib/Seaborn into the reporting process.
*   Implement logic to generate equity curve plots for each of the top N strategies. The plot should show the cumulative return over time.
*   Implement logic to generate trade plots for a representative segment of data for each top strategy, showing entry/exit points on the price chart.
*   Save the generated plots as image files (e.g., PNG) within the run's output directory (`reports/{run_id}/`).
*   Include links or embed the generated image files within the HTML and Markdown reports.
*   Add unit tests to verify that plot generation functions are called and produce output files (without necessarily verifying the visual correctness of the plots).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Matplotlib/Seaborn are integrated.
*   Equity curve plots are generated for top strategies.
*   Trade plots are generated for top strategies (for a data segment).
*   Plot images are saved to the correct output directory structure (`reports/{run_id}/`).
*   HTML and Markdown reports include references to the generated plot image files.
*   Unit tests verify that plot generation functions are invoked and output files are created.

## Tasks

1.  Install Matplotlib and Seaborn: `poetry add matplotlib seaborn`.
2.  Implement functions in `reporter.py` (or a helper module) to generate equity curve plots from backtest equity data (derived from trades).
3.  Implement functions to generate trade plots, showing price data and trade markers (entry/exit) for a selected time window.
4.  Modify the reporting logic to call these plotting functions for each top strategy.
5.  Ensure plots are saved to files with standardized names (e.g., `equity_curve_strategy_[ID].png`, `trade_plot_strategy_[ID]_[Symbol].png`).
6.  Update the report templates (HTML/Markdown) to include image tags or links pointing to the saved plot files.
7.  Add unit tests that mock the plotting library calls and verify that the reporter attempts to save plot files.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`. Plots go in `reports/{run_id}/`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jinja2.
*   **Data Models:** Uses `ReportData`, `ReportStrategyDetail`, `Trade` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`, potentially mocking plotting calls. Focus on file output.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 2 (Generate basic visualizations), Capability 4 (Analyst Reporting), User Experience (Visualizations), Sample Report structure.
