# Story 2.1: Genetic Algorithm Initialization and Population Generation

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to initialize a population of trading strategies based on the configured GA parameters (e.g., population size, initial rule sets) so that the genetic algorithm can begin evolving strategies for discovering profitable trades.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 2 (Genetic Algorithm for Strategy Discovery) and follows feature generation (Story 1.3). It sets up the GA's initial state, including generating a diverse population of trading strategies, which will be evolved through selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize for backtesting metrics.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement GA initialization logic to create an initial population of `TradingStrategy` objects based on `config.yaml` settings (e.g., population size, initial rule complexity).
- Ensure the initial population includes random or seeded strategies with varying rule combinations from available feature sets.
- Use a GA library (e.g., DEAP) for population management, or implement custom logic if needed.
- Incorporate constraints from the configuration, such as maximum rule count per strategy and diversity metrics.
- Log the initialization process, including population size and initial fitness estimates.
- Handle seeding for reproducibility if a random seed is provided in the config.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The system generates an initial population of trading strategies matching the specified size in `config.yaml`.
- AC2: Each strategy in the population includes randomly generated buy and sell rules based on available features.
- AC3: The initialization process logs key details, such as population size and any seeding used.
- AC4: Strategies adhere to configuration constraints (e.g., no strategy exceeds the maximum rule limit).
- AC5: The GA state is checkpointable from the start, allowing for resumption if needed.
- AC6: Initial fitness scores are calculated or estimated for the population before evolution begins.
- AC7: The process runs efficiently without excessive computation time for large populations.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/adaptive_trading_system/ga/engine.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/ga/population.py`, `tests/unit/ga/test_population.py`
  - Files to Modify: `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` (add GA init config), `src/adaptive_trading_system/main.py` (integrate GA initialization), `docs/data-models.md` (reference GAIndividual), `docs/api-reference.md` (document GA library usage)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - DEAP or similar GA library
  - Pandas and NumPy for strategy representation
  - Pickle or HDF5 for checkpointing

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use DEAP's toolbox for creating individuals and populations.

- **UI/UX Notes:** Log initialization progress to console.

- **Data Structures:** Leverage `GAIndividual` and `TradingStrategy` from data models.

- **Environment Variables:** Use `GA_SEED` if provided.

- **Coding Standards Notes:** Ensure thread-safe initialization; use type hints for GA components.
