# Story 2.1: Backtester Core Logic

**Epic:** 2: Strategy Backtesting Engine
**Goal:** Implement the basic `StrategyBacktester` to evaluate strategies defined by simple rules against historical data and calculate core performance metrics.

## Requirements

*   Create the `strategy_backtester.py` module within `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/`.
*   Implement a `StrategyBacktester` class or function that takes:
    *   A `TradingStrategy` object (or its rule representation).
    *   A Pandas DataFrame of historical data (including OHLCV and calculated features).
    *   Initial capital (from config).
*   Implement the core backtesting loop that iterates through the historical data bar by bar.
*   Within the loop, evaluate the strategy's `buy_rules` and `sell_rules` against the current bar's data.
*   Implement logic to execute trades (buy/sell) based on rule signals. For this story, assume fixed position sizing (e.g., buy a fixed number of shares or a fixed capital amount per trade) and no costs/slippage.
*   Track trades executed, including entry/exit price and timestamp.
*   Calculate basic performance metrics: Total Net Profit, Total Trades.
*   Add unit tests for the core backtesting logic with simple strategies and small datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py` exists.
*   The backtester can process a DataFrame and a simple `TradingStrategy` rule set.
*   The backtesting loop correctly evaluates rules bar by bar.
*   Trades are recorded when rules are met.
*   Basic metrics (Total Net Profit, Total Trades) are calculated correctly for simple scenarios.
*   Unit tests verify the backtesting engine's core trade execution and metric calculation for simple cases.

## Tasks

1.  Create `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py`.
2.  Implement the `StrategyBacktester` class/function structure.
3.  Implement the main backtesting loop.
4.  Implement logic to evaluate `StrategyRuleCondition` and `StrategyRule` against a data bar.
5.  Implement basic trade execution logic (entry/exit) without costs/slippage/advanced sizing.
6.  Implement logic to track `Trade` objects.
7.  Implement calculation of Total Net Profit and Total Trades.
8.  Define initial `TradingStrategy`, `StrategyRule`, `StrategyRuleCondition`, and `Trade` Pydantic models in `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py` based on `docs/data-models.md`.
9.  Add unit tests for the backtester using small, predefined data samples and simple strategy rules.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, `pandas`.
*   **Data Models:** Use `TradingStrategy`, `StrategyRule`, `StrategyRuleCondition`, `Trade`, `StockDataPoint` (as DataFrame) from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on the core loop and trade execution.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 2 (Strategy Backtesting) and the standardized rule format.
