# User Story 3.1: Implement Genetic Algorithm for Strategy Evolution

## Description
As a quantitative trader, I want the system to evolve trading strategies using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) so that I can discover optimized strategies based on historical data.

## Requirements
- Use the GA configuration from `config.yaml`, including parameters like population size, generations, mutation rate, and crossover rate.
- Each GA individual should be based on the `TradingStrategy` model, incorporating rules from `StrategyRule` and conditions from `StrategyRuleCondition`.
- Evolve strategies by evaluating fitness using backtest metrics such as Sharpe ratio, total net profit, and max drawdown from the `BacktestMetrics` model.
- Log evolution progress using the `GAEvolutionLogEntry` schema for tracking generations, best fitness, and average fitness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The GA successfully generates a population of `TradingStrategy` objects and iterates through the specified number of generations.
- Strategies are selected, crossed over, and mutated based on GAConfig settings.
- Output includes checkpoints as per `checkpoint_path_template` and a log file in JSON Lines format.
- Ensure compatibility with cached data from the `cached_market_data` table for efficient processing.

## Technical Context
- Implement using libraries like DEAP or custom GA logic, integrated with Pydantic models for validation.
- Handle errors for invalid strategies by checking against `TradingStrategy` validation rules.
- Testing: Unit tests for GA operators and integration tests with backtesting to verify improved fitness scores over generations.
