# Story 7.1: Post-MVP: Feedback-Driven Rule Modification

**Epic:** 7: Post-MVP Enhancements (Phase 3)
**Goal:** Implement advanced heuristic mechanisms that use feedback from past failures to intelligently guide the GA's mutation and crossover operations.

## Requirements

*   Enhance the heuristic tagging system to not just penalize, but also provide structured feedback on *why* a strategy failed (e.g., which rule condition was problematic, what type of market condition caused the failure).
*   Develop a mechanism within the `StrategyOptimizer` to store and access this structured failure feedback associated with strategy archetypes or specific rule patterns.
*   Modify the mutation and crossover operators to use this feedback. For example, if a strategy's ancestor was heavily penalized for `Whipsaw` due to a specific MA cross pattern, the mutation operator might be biased to modify or remove that pattern in offspring, or combine it with volatility filters from other parents.
*   This requires careful design to avoid premature convergence or overly aggressive filtering.
*   Update reporting (potentially a new section or enhanced existing ones) to provide insights into how feedback influenced the evolution of top strategies.
*   Add complex integration/unit tests to verify that the feedback mechanism influences GA operations as intended.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Heuristic tagging provides structured failure feedback.
*   Optimizer stores and accesses this feedback.
*   GA mutation/crossover operators use failure feedback to influence strategy modifications.
*   Feedback mechanism demonstrates a measurable impact on the types of strategies evolved (e.g., fewer strategies with previously penalized patterns over generations).
*   Reports provide insights into feedback-driven evolution.
*   Tests verify the feedback mechanism's influence on GA operations.

## Tasks

1.  Refine heuristic tagging logic (Story 3.4) to generate structured feedback objects alongside tags.
2.  Design and implement a mechanism in `StrategyOptimizer` to store and retrieve this feedback (e.g., a dictionary mapping rule patterns or strategy IDs to feedback).
3.  Modify the mutation operator to read feedback and apply targeted changes based on identified failure modes.
4.  Modify the crossover operator to potentially combine successful elements while avoiding combinations known to lead to specific failures based on feedback.
5.  Implement careful tuning and testing to ensure the feedback mechanism improves discovery efficiency and strategy quality without causing issues.
6.  Update reporting templates and logic to include a section on feedback-driven evolution insights.
7.  Add complex tests to verify the feedback mechanism's behavior.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_optimizer.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`. Update data models if needed for feedback structure.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, potentially DEAP. Requires complex algorithmic design.
*   **Data Models:** May need new data models for structured feedback. Uses `TradingStrategy`, `BacktestMetrics`, `GAConfig`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings. Isolate complex heuristic/feedback logic.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Requires complex integration/unit tests to verify algorithmic behavior.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Phase 3 (Advanced Heuristics & Portfolio View - Feedback-Driven Rule Modification), Capability 3 (Heuristic Mechanisms - Feedback-Driven Rule Modification).
