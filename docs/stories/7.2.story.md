# Story 7.2: Post-MVP: Portfolio-Level Considerations

**Epic:** 7: Post-MVP Enhancements (Phase 3)
**Goal:** Introduce analysis and reporting capabilities to understand how strategies perform together as a portfolio.

## Requirements

*   Implement logic to analyze the correlation between signals or performance of different strategies on the same set of stocks.
*   Implement a simple portfolio simulation capability in the `StrategyBacktester` or a new module. This should take a list of strategies and simulate trading them concurrently on a portfolio of stocks, managing capital allocation across strategies.
*   Calculate portfolio-level performance metrics (e.g., portfolio Sharpe Ratio, total portfolio drawdown, correlation matrix of strategy returns).
*   Update the reporting to include a new section on portfolio analysis, showing combined performance and strategy correlations for a selected set of top strategies.
*   Add tests for the correlation analysis and portfolio simulation logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   System can analyze strategy correlations.
*   System can simulate trading multiple strategies as a portfolio.
*   Portfolio-level performance metrics are calculated.
*   Reports include a portfolio analysis section.
*   Tests verify correlation analysis and portfolio simulation.

## Tasks

1.  Implement functions to calculate correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation of daily returns) between the equity curves or trade signals of multiple strategies on the same stock(s).
2.  Design and implement a simple portfolio simulation engine. This could extend the `StrategyBacktester` or be a new module. It needs to handle capital allocation rules (e.g., equal weight per strategy, dynamic allocation).
3.  Implement calculation of portfolio-level metrics from the portfolio simulation results.
4.  Update the `StrategyAnalyzer` to perform correlation analysis and portfolio simulation for a selected subset of top strategies.
5.  Update reporting templates and logic to include a "Portfolio Analysis" section showing correlation matrices, combined equity curves, and portfolio metrics.
6.  Add unit/integration tests for the correlation analysis and portfolio simulation logic.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py` or create a new module (e.g., `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/portfolio_simulator.py`), modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_analyzer.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`. Update data models if needed for portfolio results.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for portfolio equity curve/correlation plots).
*   **Data Models:** May need new data models for portfolio results and correlation data. Uses `TradingStrategy`, `BacktestMetrics`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit/integration tests for new analysis and simulation logic.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Phase 3 (Advanced Heuristics & Portfolio View - Portfolio-Level Considerations).
