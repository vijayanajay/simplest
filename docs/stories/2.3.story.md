# Story 2.3: Backtest Metrics & Trade Logging

**Epic:** 2: Strategy Backtesting Engine
**Goal:** Enhance the `StrategyBacktester` to calculate the full set of MVP performance metrics and generate the detailed trade list.

## Requirements

*   Modify the `StrategyBacktester` to calculate the full set of key performance metrics defined in `docs/data-models.md` (`BacktestMetrics` model) and PRD KPIs. This includes:
    *   Total Return (%)
    *   Sharpe Ratio
    *   Max Drawdown (%)
    *   Sortino Ratio (Optional for MVP, but include if feasible)
    *   Win Rate (%)
    *   Loss Rate (%)
    *   Average Win Profit (%)
    *   Average Loss (%)
    *   Profit Factor
    *   Total Trades (already started)
    *   Average Holding Period (bars)
*   Ensure metrics are calculated correctly based on trades *after* costs and slippage.
*   The backtester should return a `BacktestMetrics` object containing all calculated metrics and the list of executed `Trade` objects.
*   Add unit tests to verify the correctness of each calculated metric.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The `StrategyBacktester` calculates all required metrics from the `BacktestMetrics` model.
*   Metrics are calculated correctly based on trades including costs and slippage.
*   The backtester returns a `BacktestMetrics` object upon completion.
*   The returned `BacktestMetrics` object contains the full list of executed `Trade` objects.
*   Unit tests verify the correctness of each calculated metric against expected values for sample data.

## Tasks

1.  Update `BacktestMetrics` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py` to include all required fields from `docs/data-models.md` and PRD KPIs.
2.  Implement the logic within `StrategyBacktester` to calculate each of the required metrics after the backtesting loop is complete. This will involve processing the list of `Trade` objects.
3.  Ensure the `StrategyBacktester` returns a populated `BacktestMetrics` object.
4.  Add unit tests for `StrategyBacktester` focusing on the metric calculation logic. Use sample trade lists to test metric calculations independently of the backtesting loop if helpful.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py`. Update `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, `pandas`, `numpy` (for statistical calculations).
*   **Data Models:** Use `BacktestMetrics`, `Trade` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on metric calculation correctness.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Measurable Outcomes, KPIs, and Capability 2 (Backtesting).
