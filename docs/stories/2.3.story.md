# Story 2.3: Genetic Algorithm Selection and Crossover

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the genetic algorithm to perform selection and crossover operations on the population of trading strategies so that the system can evolve better strategies over generations, improving the chances of discovering profitable trading rules.

**Context:** Building on GA initialization (Story 2.1) and evolution setup, this story focuses on the core GA operators for selection (e.g., tournament selection) and crossover (e.g., combining rules from parent strategies). These operations are crucial for maintaining diversity and driving optimization toward high-fitness strategies based on backtesting metrics.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement selection mechanisms (e.g., tournament selection, roulette wheel) based on fitness scores to choose parent strategies for crossover.
- Develop crossover logic to combine rules from selected parents, ensuring offspring strategies adhere to configuration constraints (e.g., maximum rule count).
- Incorporate mutation as part of the evolution process to introduce random variations in rules.
- Ensure the process is configurable via `config.yaml` (e.g., crossover rate, mutation rate).
- Log each generation's selection and crossover outcomes, including metrics like diversity.
- Handle edge cases, such as low population diversity, to prevent premature convergence.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The system correctly selects parents based on fitness scores using the configured selection method.
- AC2: Crossover produces valid offspring strategies with combined rules from parents.
- AC3: Mutation is applied randomly to offspring, altering rules within defined limits.
- AC4: Each generation's output maintains or improves average fitness, with logs capturing key statistics.
- AC5: The process respects configuration parameters, such as crossover and mutation rates.
- AC6: Strategies generated do not violate complexity constraints, and diversity metrics are logged.
- AC7: The GA can checkpoint its state after selection and crossover for resumption.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/adaptive_trading_system/ga/operators.py`, `tests/unit/ga/test_operators.py`
  - Files to Modify: `src/adaptive_trading_system/ga/engine.py` (integrate operators), `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` (add operator configs), `docs/data-models.md` (update GAIndividual for post-crossover state)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - DEAP library for GA operators
  - NumPy for random selections and mutations

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Utilize DEAP's selection and crossover functions, customizing as needed for strategy rules.

- **UI/UX Notes:** Log generation summaries to console for user monitoring.

- **Data Structures:** Use `GAIndividual` and `TradingStrategy` models.

- **Environment Variables:** None specific.

- **Coding Standards Notes:** Ensure operators are deterministic with seeds; add extensive error handling.
