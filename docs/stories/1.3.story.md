# Story 1.3: Feature Engineering (MVP Subset)

**Epic:** 1: Core Framework & Data Handling
**Goal:** Implement the `FeatureFactory` to calculate the core MVP technical indicators and augment the historical data with these features.

## Requirements

*   Create the `feature_factory.py` module within `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/`.
*   Implement functions to calculate the following technical indicators for a given Pandas DataFrame of OHLCV data:
    *   Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    *   Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    *   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    *   MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    *   Bollinger Bands (BB)
    *   Average True Range (ATR)
    *   Basic Volume indicators (e.g., Volume SMA)
*   Ensure indicator calculations are vectorized using Pandas/NumPy for efficiency.
*   Augment the input DataFrame with new columns for each calculated indicator. Column names should be standardized (e.g., `SMA_20`, `RSI_14`).
*   The specific periods/parameters for these indicators should be configurable, initially using a small, predefined set of common values as per PRD Phase 1 simplification.
*   Add unit tests for each indicator calculation function to verify correctness against known examples or other libraries (e.g., TA-Lib if used internally for validation).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/feature_factory.py` exists.
*   Functions for calculating SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, BB, ATR, and Volume SMA are implemented.
*   Indicator calculations are vectorized.
*   The `FeatureFactory` can take an OHLCV DataFrame and return a new DataFrame with indicator columns added.
*   Indicator parameters are read from the configuration.
*   Unit tests verify the correctness of indicator calculations.

## Tasks

1.  Create `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/feature_factory.py`.
2.  Implement vectorized functions for each required indicator (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, BB, ATR, Volume SMA). Use Pandas built-in functions or NumPy where appropriate.
3.  Create a main `FeatureFactory` class or function that takes a DataFrame and configuration, calculates specified indicators, and returns the augmented DataFrame.
4.  Update `CLIConfiguration` and `FeatureConfig` Pydantic models in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include parameters for selecting features and their periods (e.g., `sma_periods: List[int]`, `rsi_periods: List[int]`). Use default common values.
5.  Add unit tests for each indicator calculation, potentially comparing results against a known library like `TA-Lib` on sample data.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/feature_factory.py`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, `pandas`, `numpy`. `TA-Lib` can be used for validation in tests but should not be a core dependency for calculation if possible (to avoid installation complexity), unless decided otherwise.
*   **Data Models:** Input is a Pandas DataFrame conceptually matching `StockDataPoint` (without the `indicators` dict initially, adding columns instead). Output is the same DataFrame augmented.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings. Prioritize vectorization for performance.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on calculation correctness.
*   **PRD:** Refers to MVP Feature Scope in Phase 1.
