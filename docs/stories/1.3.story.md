# Story 1.3: Feature Generation & Engineering

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically generate and engineer features from the historical stock data (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD, volume-based indicators) based on the configured feature families so that the genetic algorithm can evaluate trading strategies effectively.

**Context:** This story extends the data fetching (Story 1.2) by processing raw OHLCV data into meaningful features, which are essential inputs for the genetic algorithm in Epic 2. It ensures that feature generation is configurable, efficient, and integrated with the overall system pipeline, supporting the discovery of profitable trading strategies.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement a feature engineering module that takes cached OHLCV data as input and generates features based on user-configured families (e.g., technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
- Use libraries like TA-Lib or Pandas for computing indicators.
- Ensure feature generation is parallelizable for performance on multi-core systems.
- Implement caching for generated features to avoid recomputation.
- Allow configuration of feature parameters (e.g., window sizes for moving averages) via `config.yaml`.
- Handle edge cases, such as insufficient data for certain features.
- Log feature generation progress and any warnings (e.g., skipped features due to data issues).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The system generates a set of features for each stock based on the configured feature families.
- AC2: Features are computed correctly using appropriate libraries (e.g., TA-Lib for technical indicators).
- AC3: Generated features are cached for reuse in subsequent runs.
- AC4: The system logs detailed information about feature generation, including time taken and any errors.
- AC5: Configuration changes in `config.yaml` (e.g., adding/removing feature families) reflect in the generated features.
- AC6: Feature generation handles incomplete data gracefully, logging warnings without halting the process.
- AC7: The output of feature generation is in a format suitable for input to the genetic algorithm (e.g., Pandas DataFrames).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/feature_engine.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/data/cache/features_cache.sqlite`, `tests/unit/components/test_feature_engine.py`
  - Files to Modify: `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` (add feature config), `src/adaptive_trading_system/main.py` (integrate feature generation), `docs/data-models.md` (define feature schemas), `docs/api-reference.md` (document TA-Lib usage)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - TA-Lib (for technical indicators)
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - SQLite (for caching features)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use TA-Lib functions like `ta.RSI`, `ta.MACD` on Pandas DataFrames.
  - Interact with SQLite for caching generated features.

- **UI/UX Notes:** Log progress to console for user feedback.

- **Data Structures:** Define feature output as DataFrames with multi-index for stocks and dates.

- **Environment Variables:** None specific, but use config for flexibility.

- **Coding Standards Notes:** Ensure modular code with type hints; handle exceptions properly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement the feature engineering function with support for multiple indicator families.
- [ ] Add configuration parsing for feature parameters.
- [ ] Integrate caching logic for features.
- [ ] Write unit tests for individual indicators.
- [ ] Handle edge cases in feature generation.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual feature calculations and caching.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify end-to-end feature generation from cached data.
