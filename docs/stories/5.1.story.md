# Story 5.1: Integrate Pipeline Components

**Epic:** 5: Main Application Pipeline (Implicit Epic to connect components)
**Goal:** Integrate the developed components (FeatureFactory, StrategyOptimizer, StrategyBacktester, StrategyAnalyzer, Reporter) into a single, executable pipeline triggered by the CLI.

## Requirements

*   Modify the main CLI command (`tradefinder discover`) to orchestrate the execution of the core components in sequence:
    1.  Load configuration.
    2.  Initialize logging.
    3.  Fetch and cache historical data using `FeatureFactory`'s data fetching capabilities.
    4.  Generate features using `FeatureFactory`.
    5.  Initialize and run the `StrategyOptimizer` (which internally uses the `StrategyBacktester` for fitness evaluation).
    6.  Initialize the `StrategyAnalyzer` with the results from the optimizer and backtester.
    7.  Generate reports using the `Reporter`.
*   Ensure data flows correctly between components (e.g., DataFrame from FeatureFactory to Optimizer, Strategy/Metrics from Optimizer/Backtester to Analyzer).
*   Implement error handling at the pipeline level to catch exceptions from components and provide informative messages to the user.
*   Add an end-to-end (E2E) test that runs the full `tradefinder discover` command with a sample configuration and verifies that output reports are generated.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Running `tradefinder discover --config-file <sample_config.yaml>` executes the full pipeline.
*   Data flows correctly between FeatureFactory, Optimizer, Backtester, Analyzer, and Reporter.
*   The system generates the expected report files (`Top Strategies Report`, `Failures Report`, `Strategy Ledger`, plots) in the output directory.
*   Basic pipeline-level error handling is present.
*   The E2E test runs successfully and verifies report generation.

## Tasks

1.  Modify the `tradefinder discover` command logic in `src/adaptive_trading_system/cli/commands.py`.
2.  Import and instantiate the main classes/functions from `FeatureFactory`, `StrategyOptimizer`, `StrategyBacktester`, `StrategyAnalyzer`, and `Reporter`.
3.  Call the component functions/methods in the correct sequence, passing data and configuration as needed.
4.  Implement `try...except` blocks in the main pipeline logic to catch component-level exceptions and log/report them.
5.  Create a sample `config.yaml` file in `tests/e2e/test_data/` suitable for a quick E2E run (small date range, few stocks, low GA generations).
6.  Write an E2E test in `tests/e2e/test_cli_commands.py` that uses `subprocess` to run the `tradefinder discover` command with the sample config and asserts the existence of expected output files.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/cli/commands.py`. Interacts with all components in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/`. Uses config from `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/`. Output goes to `reports/`. Add E2E test in `tests/e2e/`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, Typer, subprocess. Integrates all previously used libraries.
*   **Data Models:** Data flows between components using Pandas DataFrames, `TradingStrategy`, `BacktestMetrics`, `ReportData`, etc., as defined in `docs/data-models.md`. Uses `CLIConfiguration`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings. Implement robust error handling at the pipeline level.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add a comprehensive E2E test using `pytest` and `subprocess`.
*   **PRD:** Describes the overall system flow and user journey (Analyst Initiates a New Strategy Discovery Run).
