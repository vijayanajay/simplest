# User Story 4.3: System Monitoring and Continuous Optimization

## Description
As a quantitative trader, I want the system to include monitoring and continuous optimization features so that I can track live trading performance and iteratively improve strategies based on new data.

## Requirements
- Extend the `GAEvolutionLogEntry` and `BacktestMetrics` models to include ongoing monitoring data, such as real-time performance metrics and alerts for deviations from expected KPIs.
- Implement automated re-optimization triggers in the GA based on configurable thresholds in `config.yaml`, using new data from `StockDataPoint` to evolve strategies periodically.
- Integrate with reporting tools to generate periodic updates, incorporating data from the database schemas like `cached_market_data` for trend analysis.
- Ensure logging captures optimization cycles, including changes to `TradingStrategy` parameters and their impact on metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system monitors live trades and triggers re-optimization when metrics like Sharpe ratio fall below thresholds, validating against `BacktestMetrics`.
- Output includes updated reports and logs in the specified formats, with clear documentation of changes to strategies.
- Handle data updates seamlessly, ensuring no interruptions to live trading, and log all optimization events for review.
- Testing: End-to-end tests for monitoring loops and unit tests for optimization logic to confirm strategy improvements over time.

## Technical Context
- Use libraries like Prometheus for monitoring and integrate with the GA framework (e.g., DEAP) for dynamic re-optimization, ensuring all data is validated via Pydantic models.
- Leverage SQLite for storing monitoring data and schedule optimizations via background processes, with alerts integrated into the reporting module for real-time notifications.
