# Story 3.2: GA Genetic Operators

**Epic:** 3: GA Strategy Optimizer
**Goal:** Implement the core genetic operators (crossover and mutation) for evolving trading strategies within the GA.

## Requirements

*   Implement a crossover operator that takes two parent `TradingStrategy` individuals and produces one or two offspring strategies. The crossover should combine parts of the parent strategies' rule sets or parameters in a meaningful way.
*   Implement a mutation operator that takes a `TradingStrategy` individual and introduces small, random changes (e.g., modifying a parameter, adding/removing a condition, changing an operator).
*   Ensure genetic operators respect the defined constraints on strategy structure and parameter ranges (from `FeatureConfig` and `GAConfig`).
*   The rates for crossover and mutation should be configurable via the GA settings in `config.yaml`.
*   Add unit tests for the crossover and mutation operators to verify they produce valid strategies and introduce changes as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Crossover operator is implemented and produces valid `TradingStrategy` offspring from two parents.
*   Mutation operator is implemented and produces a valid `TradingStrategy` with random changes.
*   Genetic operators respect strategy structure and parameter constraints.
*   Crossover and mutation rates are configurable.
*   Unit tests verify the behavior and output validity of crossover and mutation.

## Tasks

1.  Implement the crossover function/method in `strategy_optimizer.py`.
2.  Implement the mutation function/method in `strategy_optimizer.py`.
3.  Ensure operators use the available features and parameter ranges defined in the configuration.
4.  Update `GAConfig` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include `mutation_rate` and `crossover_rate`.
5.  Add unit tests for the crossover and mutation operators, checking output validity and that changes occurred.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_optimizer.py`. Update config.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, potentially DEAP or NumPy for custom GA.
*   **Data Models:** Operate on `TradingStrategy` objects. Use `GAConfig` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on operator correctness and output validity.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 3 (GA).
