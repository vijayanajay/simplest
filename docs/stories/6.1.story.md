# Story 6.1: Post-MVP: Dynamic Exit Mechanisms

**Epic:** 6: Post-MVP Enhancements (Phase 2)
**Goal:** Introduce more dynamic and adaptive exit mechanisms into the trading strategy definition and backtester.

## Requirements

*   Update the `TradingStrategy` and `StrategyRule` data models to support new types of exit conditions beyond fixed profit targets and stop losses.
*   Implement logic in the `StrategyBacktester` to handle these new exit types:
    *   Trailing stops (percentage-based and/or ATR-based).
    *   Indicator-based exits (e.g., exit when RSI crosses below a threshold, or when price crosses a moving average).
    *   Time-based exits (e.g., exit after a fixed number of bars).
*   Modify the GA's mutation and crossover operators to be able to generate and modify strategies using these new exit mechanisms.
*   Update the reporting to clearly describe the dynamic exit logic used by evolved strategies.
*   Add unit tests for the new exit logic in the backtester.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Strategy data models support new exit types.
*   Backtester correctly executes trades using trailing stops, indicator-based exits, and time-based exits.
*   GA operators can evolve strategies with these new exits.
*   Reports accurately describe the dynamic exit rules.
*   Unit tests verify the new exit logic.

## Tasks

1.  Update `StrategyRuleCondition` and `TradingStrategy` Pydantic models to accommodate new exit types and their parameters. Consider adding an `exit_rules` list similar to `buy_rules`/`sell_rules`.
2.  Modify the backtesting loop in `StrategyBacktester` to check for and execute the new dynamic exit conditions.
3.  Implement the calculation logic for trailing stops (percentage and ATR).
4.  Implement the evaluation logic for indicator-based and time-based exits within the backtester.
5.  Update the GA's mutation and crossover operators to include operations that add, remove, or modify dynamic exit rules/parameters.
6.  Update the reporting logic and templates to display the new exit rule formats.
7.  Add unit tests for the backtester covering each new dynamic exit type.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_optimizer.py`, `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`. Update data models and config.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, Pandas, NumPy.
*   **Data Models:** Update `TradingStrategy`, `StrategyRule`, `StrategyRuleCondition` from `docs/data-models.md`. Update config for new parameters.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests for backtester exit logic. Update GA operator tests.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Phase 2 (Enhancing Strategy Intelligence & Granularity - Introduce Dynamic Exit Mechanisms).
