# Story 5.3: Comprehensive Testing & Refinement

**Epic:** 5: Main Application Pipeline (Implicit Epic to connect components)
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and specialized tests, and perform overall system refinement based on testing and review.

## Requirements

*   Implement remaining unit tests identified in previous stories and the `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Aim for high code coverage (e.g., >85%) for core logic.
*   Implement integration tests to verify the interaction between key components (e.g., FeatureFactory -> Backtester, Optimizer -> Backtester).
*   Implement specialized tests as outlined in `docs/testing-strategy.md`:
    *   Reproducibility tests (verify runs with fixed seeds are identical).
    *   Baseline strategy tests (implement baselines and compare GA results).
    *   Robustness & Validation tests (Multi-Stock, Out-of-Sample, Adversarial Simulation on selected regimes). This may involve preparing specific test data sets.
*   Ensure all tests are integrated into the GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/main.yml`).
*   Configure code coverage reporting in CI (`pytest-cov`) and potentially enforce a minimum coverage threshold.
*   Perform profiling and optimization based on performance testing results, focusing on the GA evaluation loop.
*   Address any bugs or issues found during testing and internal review.
*   Ensure all Pydantic models have appropriate validation rules implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Comprehensive unit tests are implemented with high coverage for core modules.
*   Integration tests verify component interactions.
*   Reproducibility tests pass.
*   Baseline strategies are implemented, and a comparison methodology is documented/tested.
*   Robustness and validation tests are implemented and can be run.
*   All tests run successfully in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
*   Code coverage is reported in CI and meets the target threshold.
*   Performance bottlenecks identified during profiling are addressed.
*   Known bugs are fixed.
*   Pydantic models include validation rules.

## Tasks

1.  Review existing unit tests and write additional tests to increase coverage, focusing on edge cases and complex logic paths.
2.  Write integration tests for key component interactions.
3.  Implement reproducibility tests using fixed seeds and comparing outputs.
4.  Implement simple baseline strategies (e.g., SMA Crossover) and a script/test to run them and compare results with GA output.
5.  Prepare test data sets for robustness testing (different stocks, OOS periods, regime slices).
6.  Implement tests or scripts to run top strategies on these robustness test data sets and analyze results.
7.  Update `.github/workflows/main.yml` to include all test levels (unit, integration, E2E, specialized).
8.  Configure `pytest-cov` in `pyproject.toml` or `.coveragerc` and update CI to report coverage.
9.  Use profiling tools (`cProfile`, `line_profiler`) to identify performance bottlenecks, especially in the backtesting and fitness evaluation loops.
10. Optimize critical code sections based on profiling results.
11. Address any issues found during manual testing or code review.
12. Add validation rules (e.g., `gt=0`, `ge=0`, validators) to Pydantic models in `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py` and `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py`.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement tests in `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`. Update `.github/workflows/main.yml`. Update Pydantic models.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, pytest, pytest-cov, unittest.mock/pytest-mock, cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler, pandas, numpy.
*   **Data Models:** Ensure Pydantic models have validation rules.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards. Focus on testability and performance optimization.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Implement all levels and types of tests defined in `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Use CI for enforcement.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Testing Requirements (Comprehensive unit tests, Integration tests, Robustness & Validation Testing Methodology, Overfitting Checks, Reporting Tests, Baseline Strategy Tests, Reproducibility Testing, Performance Testing, Heuristic Logic Testing), NFRs (Performance, Reliability, Maintainability - Typing, Linting, Testing).
