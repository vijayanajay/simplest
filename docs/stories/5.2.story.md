# Story 5.2: Documentation & Setup Script

**Epic:** 5: Main Application Pipeline (Implicit Epic to connect components)
**Goal:** Provide clear documentation and a simple script to help users set up the local Python environment and run the application.

## Requirements

*   Create or update the main `README.md` file in the project root.
*   The `README.md` should include:
    *   Project overview and goals.
    *   Instructions for setting up a local Python environment (e.g., using `venv` or Poetry).
    *   Instructions for installing dependencies using `poetry install`.
    *   Basic usage instructions for the `tradefinder discover` CLI command, including how to specify a configuration file.
    *   Explanation of the default output directory structure (`reports/{run_id}/`).
    *   Links to key documentation files in the `docs/` directory (PRD, Architecture, Tech Stack, etc.).
*   Create a simple setup script (e.g., `setup_env.bat` for Windows) in the `scripts/` directory.
*   The setup script should automate the creation of a Python virtual environment and installation of dependencies using Poetry.
*   Ensure the setup instructions and script are clear and easy to follow for a user on a local Windows machine.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   `README.md` is updated with setup and basic usage instructions.
*   A setup script (`setup_env.bat`) exists in the `scripts/` directory.
*   The setup script successfully creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies when executed on a Windows machine with Python and Poetry installed.
*   A user following the `README.md` instructions can successfully set up the environment and run the basic `tradefinder discover` command with a sample config.

## Tasks

1.  Update `README.md` with sections for Setup, Installation, and Usage.
2.  Write clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up a virtual environment (using `venv` or Poetry's default env).
3.  Write instructions for installing dependencies (`poetry install`).
4.  Write basic usage instructions for the CLI, referencing the example config files.
5.  Create the `scripts/setup_env.bat` file.
6.  Write the batch script commands to create a `venv` (or use Poetry's env management) and run `poetry install`.
7.  Test the setup instructions and script on a clean Windows environment (if possible) or simulate the steps.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Update `README.md`. Create `scripts/setup_env.bat`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Refers to Python, Poetry.
*   **Coding Standards:** Ensure scripts are simple and well-commented if necessary.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Manual testing of setup instructions and script.
*   **PRD:** Refers to User Stories (run on local Windows machine with minimal setup hassle), NFRs (Usability, Deployment Considerations - Local deployment, Setup).
