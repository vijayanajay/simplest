# Story 5.4: Final Review & Documentation Polish

**Epic:** 5: Main Application Pipeline (Implicit Epic to connect components)
**Goal:** Conduct a final review of the code and documentation, ensuring everything is consistent, clear, and meets the MVP requirements.

## Requirements

*   Review all code for adherence to coding standards (`docs/coding-standards.md`).
*   Ensure all public functions, classes, and modules have clear docstrings (Google Style).
*   Verify type hints are used consistently and MyPy passes without errors.
*   Review all documentation files (`docs/`) for accuracy, completeness, and consistency with the implemented system.
*   Update `docs/api-reference.md` to accurately reflect the CLI commands and configuration schema.
*   Update `docs/data-models.md` to reflect the final Pydantic models used.
*   Update `docs/tech-stack.md` with final library versions used.
*   Update `docs/environment-vars.md` with any environment variables actually used.
*   Update `docs/testing-strategy.md` with details on implemented tests and coverage targets.
*   Ensure the `README.md` is up-to-date and provides a good entry point for users.
*   Conduct a final end-to-end test run to verify the complete system works as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Codebase adheres to coding standards (verified by linters/formatters/type checker in CI).
*   Docstrings are present and correctly formatted for public API.
*   MyPy passes cleanly.
*   All documentation files in `docs/` are reviewed and updated.
*   `README.md` is current and helpful.
*   The final E2E test run is successful.
*   The system is ready for MVP release/review.

## Tasks

1.  Perform a final code review focusing on standards, docstrings, and type hints.
2.  Run linters, formatters, and MyPy one last time to catch any issues.
3.  Review and update `docs/api-reference.md`.
4.  Review and update `docs/data-models.md`.
5.  Review and update `docs/tech-stack.md`.
6.  Review and update `docs/environment-vars.md`.
7.  Review and update `docs/testing-strategy.md`.
8.  Review and update `README.md`.
9.  Perform a final end-to-end test run using a representative configuration.
10. Ensure all generated reports are correct and match the sample structure.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Review all files in `src/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use all configured linters, formatters, type checker.
*   **Data Models:** Final review of all Pydantic models.
*   **Coding Standards:** Apply all standards rigorously.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Ensure all tests pass and documentation reflects testing approach.
*   **PRD:** Final check against MVP requirements.
