# User Story 4.1: Integrate Live Trading Execution

## Description
As a quantitative trader, I want the system to support live trading execution based on the best evolved strategies so that I can apply them in real-time market conditions with risk management.

## Requirements
- Extend the `TradingStrategy` model to include live execution parameters, such as real-time data feeds and API integrations for brokers (e.g., via yfinance or Alpaca).
- Use `Trade` objects to handle live trades, incorporating real-time `StockDataPoint` updates and signals from `TradingSignal`.
- Implement risk controls based on backtest metrics, like setting stop-loss levels from `BacktestMetrics` max_drawdown_percent.
- Ensure compatibility with the configuration in `config.yaml` for API keys and live mode settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system successfully executes trades in a simulated live environment before going live, validating against `StrategyRule` conditions.
- Monitor and log live trades using the same schemas as backtesting, including profit/loss calculations.
- Handle errors such as API failures or market data delays, with fallback to HOLD signals.
- Testing: Integration tests with mock brokers to verify trade execution and end-to-end tests for strategy application in live-like conditions.

## Technical Context
- Use libraries like ccxt for broker API interactions, integrated with Pydantic for data validation.
- Ensure data flows from cached sources or real-time feeds into the GA-evolved strategies, with logging to `GAEvolutionLogEntry` for ongoing performance tracking.
