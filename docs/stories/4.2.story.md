# Story 4.2: Top Strategies Report

**Epic:** 4: Analysis & Reporting
**Goal:** Generate the "Top Strategies Report" in HTML and Markdown formats, detailing the logic, performance, and heuristic profile of the top N strategies.

## Requirements

*   Create the `reporter.py` module within `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/`.
*   Implement logic to generate the "Top Strategies Report" using the `ReportData` object prepared by the `StrategyAnalyzer`.
*   The report should include:
    *   Executive Summary (high-level run details, best strategy).
    *   Detailed sections for each of the top N strategies.
    *   For each strategy: human-readable logic, parameters, aggregated multi-stock performance metrics (including costs/sizing), per-stock performance breakdown, validation status, and heuristic tags.
    *   Translate technical heuristic tags into more narrative explanations where feasible, as per PRD.
*   Generate the report in both HTML and Markdown formats using a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2).
*   Save the generated reports to the output directory specified in the configuration, typically within a subdirectory named by the `run_id`.
*   Add unit tests to verify report content generation (e.g., checking if strategy details, metrics, and tags are correctly included).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py` exists.
*   The reporter can generate the "Top Strategies Report" from a `ReportData` object.
*   HTML and Markdown versions of the report are generated.
*   Reports are saved to the correct output directory structure (`reports/{run_id}/`).
*   Reports include all required sections and details for the top N strategies as per requirements and sample report structure.
*   Heuristic tags are presented with narrative explanations in the report.
*   Unit tests verify that key information is present and correctly formatted in the generated report content (without necessarily testing the full HTML/Markdown rendering).

## Tasks

1.  Create `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`.
2.  Choose and integrate a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2).
3.  Create Jinja2 templates (or similar) for the HTML and Markdown "Top Strategies Report". Refer to `docs/sample_report.md` for structure.
4.  Implement logic in `reporter.py` to load templates, render them with the `ReportData` object, and save the output files.
5.  Implement the translation of heuristic tags into narrative explanations within the reporting logic.
6.  Update `ReportingConfig` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include `report_formats` and `output_directory`.
7.  Add unit tests for the reporting logic, verifying that data from `ReportData` is correctly used in the report content generation.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Implement in `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/reporter.py`. Templates might go in a `templates/reports/` directory. Output goes in `reports/{run_id}/`. Update config.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, Jinja2, potentially Pandas for data formatting within reports.
*   **Data Models:** Uses `ReportData`, `ReportStrategyDetail`, `TradingStrategy`, `BacktestMetrics` from `docs/data-models.md`. Uses `ReportingConfig` from config.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on report content generation logic.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Capability 4 (Analyst Reporting), Phase 1 (Prioritized Reporting), User Stories (see exact logic, view key performance metrics, report summarizing top strategies), Sample Report structure.
