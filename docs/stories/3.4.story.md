# Story 3.4: Final Strategy Selection and Recommendations

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to select the final set of optimized trading strategies based on comprehensive evaluation and provide actionable recommendations so that I can confidently choose strategies for potential live deployment or further manual refinement.

**Context:** This story concludes Epic 3 (Backtesting and Evaluation) by synthesizing results from previous stories (3.1-3.3), applying selection criteria to identify top strategies, and generating recommendations that consider factors like robustness, risk, and market conditions, ensuring the output is practical for real-world application.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement logic to rank and select final strategies from the refined set, using multi-factor criteria (e.g., highest Sharpe ratio, lowest drawdown, sensitivity stability) as defined in `config.yaml`.
- Generate recommendations, including suggested parameter tweaks, risk assessments, and compatibility with different market scenarios.
- Integrate with reporting to produce a 'final recommendations' section in reports, highlighting selected strategies and their projected performance.
- Allow for user-defined selection rules, such as minimum return thresholds or maximum risk tolerance.
- Log the selection process, including rationale for choices and any trade-offs.
- Ensure the system outputs a summary of selected strategies in a format suitable for export or integration with other tools.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The system accurately selects and ranks strategies based on configured criteria from backtest and sensitivity results.
- AC2: Recommendations include detailed insights, such as potential improvements and risk warnings.
- AC3: Final reports incorporate the selected strategies and recommendations without errors.
- AC4: The selection process logs all decisions, making it transparent and auditable.
- AC5: Edge cases, like no viable strategies, are handled with fallback recommendations or alerts.
- AC6: Outputs are customizable and can be exported in multiple formats.
- AC7: The entire process is efficient, leveraging cached data to avoid redundant computations.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/adaptive_trading_system/analysis/selection.py`, `tests/unit/analysis/test_selection.py`
  - Files to Modify: `src/adaptive_trading_system/reporting/generator.py` (add recommendations), `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` (add selection configs), `docs/data-models.md` (update for recommendation structures)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Pandas for data ranking and analysis
  - NumPy for statistical computations

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Reuse existing backtesting and reporting components.

- **UI/UX Notes:** Make recommendations user-friendly, with clear language and visual aids in reports.

- **Data Structures:** Extend `BacktestMetrics` and `ReportData` for selection outputs.

- **Environment Variables:** None specific.

- **Coding Standards Notes:** Ensure selection algorithms are unbiased and well-tested; use descriptive logging.
