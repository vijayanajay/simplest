# Story 2.2: Backtester Enhancements (Costs, Sizing)

**Epic:** 2: Strategy Backtesting Engine
**Goal:** Add realistic transaction costs, slippage, and basic position sizing to the `StrategyBacktester`.

## Requirements

*   Modify the `StrategyBacktester` to incorporate transaction costs (commission and statutory charges) as a percentage of trade value, configurable via the backtest settings.
*   Implement a basic slippage model (e.g., fixed percentage or fixed ticks) applied to entry and exit prices, configurable via the backtest settings.
*   Implement basic position sizing logic, specifically fixed fractional sizing (e.g., risking a fixed percentage of current equity per trade), configurable via the backtest settings.
*   Ensure trade profit/loss calculations correctly account for costs and slippage.
*   Update the `Trade` data model to store cost and slippage details for each trade.
*   Update the `BacktestMetrics` calculation to reflect net profit *after* costs and slippage.
*   Add unit tests to verify cost, slippage, and position sizing calculations.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The backtester calculates trade profit/loss net of configured commission and slippage.
*   The backtester uses fixed fractional position sizing based on configured parameters and current equity.
*   The `Trade` model includes fields for costs and slippage.
*   Net Profit metric in `BacktestMetrics` is calculated after accounting for costs and slippage.
*   Unit tests verify the correctness of cost, slippage, and sizing calculations in isolation and combination.

## Tasks

1.  Update `BacktestConfig` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` to include `commission_percent`, `slippage_percent`, and position sizing parameters (e.g., `position_sizing: Dict`).
2.  Update `Trade` Pydantic model in `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py` to add fields for costs and slippage.
3.  Modify the trade execution logic in `StrategyBacktester` to calculate and apply costs and slippage to entry/exit prices and update `Trade` objects.
4.  Implement the fixed fractional position sizing logic to determine the number of shares to trade based on current capital and configured risk fraction.
5.  Update the Net Profit calculation in `StrategyBacktester` to sum net profits from trades after costs/slippage.
6.  Add unit tests specifically for the cost, slippage, and sizing calculations, using small, controlled scenarios.

## Technical Context

*   **Project Structure:** Modify `src/adaptive_trading_system/components/strategy_backtester.py`. Update config and data models in `src/adaptive_trading_system/config/settings.py` and `src/adaptive_trading_system/common/data_models.py`.
*   **Tech Stack:** Use Python, `pandas`.
*   **Data Models:** Update `Trade`, `BacktestMetrics`, `BacktestConfig` from `docs/data-models.md`.
*   **Coding Standards:** Adhere to standards, use type hints, docstrings.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Add unit tests using `pytest`. Focus on calculation correctness for costs, slippage, and sizing.
*   **PRD:** Refers to Phase 1 priorities: Integrate Transaction Costs and Slippage, Implement Basic Position Sizing.
