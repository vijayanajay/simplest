# Epic 4: Analysis & Reporting

**Goal:** Consume the outputs from the GA optimizer and backtester, generate comprehensive reports on top strategies, and provide visualizations and summaries to enable user analysis of strategy performance and robustness.

## Story List

### Story 4.1: Reporting Engine Implementation

- **User Story / Goal:** As a user, I want a reporting engine that compiles backtest metrics, GA evolution logs, and strategy details into readable formats so that I can review and interpret the results of strategy discovery runs.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement the `ReportingEngine` component to process inputs like BacktestMetrics, GAEvolutionLogEntry, and TradingStrategy objects.
  - Support output in multiple formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown, CSV) as specified in the PRD.
  - Ensure reports include sections for overall summary, top strategies, per-stock metrics, and GA progress visualizations.
  - Integrate with configuration for customizing report content (e.g., top N strategies, report formats).
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: The reporting engine generates reports in the specified formats.
  - AC2: Reports include all key metrics and summaries from the inputs.
  - AC3: The engine respects user configuration for report customization.

### Story 4.2: Visualization and Insights Generation

- **User Story / Goal:** As an analyst, I want visualizations and basic insights (e.g., equity curves, performance charts) in the reports so that I can visually assess strategy effectiveness and identify patterns.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to generate plots (e.g., equity curves, drawdown charts, fitness over generations).
  - Embed or reference visualizations in report outputs.
  - Provide simple textual insights, such as highlighting strategies with high Sharpe ratios or low drawdowns.
  - Ensure visualizations are saved as image files for inclusion in HTML/Markdown reports.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: Reports include at least equity curves and GA fitness progression charts.
  - AC2: Visualizations are correctly embedded or linked in the output formats.
  - AC3: Insights are generated and included as textual summaries.

### Story 4.3: Report Distribution and Storage

- **User Story / Goal:** As a user, I want reports to be saved in a configurable directory and optionally exported for easy sharing so that I can archive and review results outside the application.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement logic to save reports to a user-specified output directory.
  - Support exporting reports via file paths or basic integration (e.g., opening HTML in a browser).
  - Ensure report files are named with run IDs for traceability.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: Reports are saved to the configured directory.
  - AC2: File names include run-specific identifiers.
  - AC3: The system provides options for immediate viewing or export.
