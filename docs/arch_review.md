# MEQSAP Architectural Review - 2025-06-18

This document outlines architectural directives, new critical flaws, and strategic imperatives identified during the audit.

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-18

## Part 1A: Compliance Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** Documentation Inaccuracy in `examples/indian_stock_sample.yaml`
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
    The incorrect comment in `examples/indian_stock_sample.yaml` at line 42 has been corrected to state that `objective_function` names are case-sensitive. This now aligns with the implementation in `src/meqsap/optimizer/objective_functions.py` and prevents user confusion. The fix is verified by code inspection.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** Critical Logic Failure & Architectural Degeneration in `optimize.py` and `engine.py`
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
    The codebase was inspected and found to be compliant with the required actions for this directive.
    1.  **Exit Code Policy:** The `handle_cli_errors` decorator in `src/meqsap/cli/utils.py` correctly maps `OptimizationError` to exit code 6 and `OptimizationInterrupted` to exit code 7. The `optimize` command logic in `src/meqsap/cli/commands/optimize.py` correctly raises these exceptions instead of calling `typer.Exit`.
    2.  **Interruption Handling:** The `OptimizationEngine` in `src/meqsap/optimizer/engine.py` correctly contains a `try/except KeyboardInterrupt` block that sets the `was_interrupted` flag on the `OptimizationResult`. The CLI command in `optimize.py` does not contain a conflicting `try/except` block and correctly inspects the result flag to determine the outcome.
    This flaw is considered fully resolved.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

## Part 1B: New Critical Architectural Flaws

No new critical architectural flaws were identified during this audit cycle.

## Part 2: Strategic Architectural Imperatives

N/A.

## Part 3: Actionable Technical Debt Rectification

No new technical debt logged. All identified critical flaws are being fixed in this cycle.

## Part 4: Audit Conclusion & Next Steps Mandate

1.  **Critical Path to Compliance:** All identified architectural flaws from the previous audit have been resolved.
2.  **System Integrity Verdict:** **IMPROVED**. The resolution of the exit code policy violation, broken interruption handling, and documentation inaccuracy has significantly improved the system's architectural integrity, reliability, and user trust.
3.  **`arch_review.md` Update Instruction:** This document serves as the updated `arch_review.md`. There are no outstanding issues to carry forward.
4.  **`resolved_issues.md` Maintenance Confirmation:** `resolved_issues.md` has been updated to log the resolution of the two flaws from the 2025-06-17 audit.
