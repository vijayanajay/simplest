# MEQSAP Architectural Review - 2025-06-03

This document outlines architectural directives, new critical flaws, and strategic imperatives identified during the audit.

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-03

## Part 1A: Compliance Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-001 (Local ConfigError in config.py)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   `src/meqsap/config.py` correctly imports `ConfigurationError` from `src/meqsap/exceptions.py` and does not define a local `ConfigError`. `src/meqsap/cli.py` also imports and uses `ConfigurationError` from `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`. This aligns with ADR-004 and `memory.md` guidance. Verified `resolved_issues.md` entry for FLAW-20250601-001 is accurate and reflects this resolution.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-002 (Doc misalignment for CLI exceptions)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   `docs/adr/004-error-handling-policy.md` (Exception Hierarchy) and `docs/policies/error-handling-policy.md` (Exception Mapping) correctly include CLI-specific exceptions (`DataAcquisitionError`, `BacktestExecutionError`, `ReportGenerationError`) as subclasses of `CLIError`, aligning with `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`. Verified `resolved_issues.md` entry for FLAW-20250601-002 is accurate.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-003 (Doc inaccuracy in architecture.md project structure)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   The "Project Structure" diagram in `docs/architecture.md` now correctly includes `src/meqsap/exceptions.py`, the `examples/` directory, and detailed `docs/` subdirectories (`adr/`, `policies/`), accurately reflecting the project structure. Verified `resolved_issues.md` entry for FLAW-20250601-003 is accurate.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-004 (Doc error in adr-002-date-range-handling.md validation logic)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   `docs/adr/adr-002-date-range-handling.md` (section "Internal Implementation") has been updated with the correct validation logic example: "`Validation logic ensures data for the inclusive `end_date` is present, such as `dates.max() >= pd.Timestamp(end_date)` after yfinance fetching and adjustment.`". Verified `resolved_issues.md` entry for FLAW-20250601-004 is accurate.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250602-001 (Incorrect Error Handling & Exit Code in CLI)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Code in `src/meqsap/cli.py` has been verified:
   1.  `_main_pipeline`'s final `except Exception` block correctly calls `_generate_error_message(e, verbose=verbose, no_color=no_color)` and returns `10`.
   2.  `analyze_command`'s final `except Exception` block raises `typer.Exit(code=10)`.
   3.  `_generate_error_message` signature is `def _generate_error_message(exception: Exception, verbose: bool = False, no_color: bool = False) -> str:`.
   4.  `_get_recovery_suggestions` signature is `def _get_recovery_suggestions(exception: Exception) -> list[str]:`.
   These changes align with ADR-004. Verified `resolved_issues.md` entry for FLAW-20250602-001 is accurate.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

## Part 1B: New Critical Architectural Flaws

No new critical architectural flaws were identified in this audit cycle.
Minor code hygiene issues (debug print statements in `src/meqsap/config.py`) were identified and rectified directly.

## Part 2: Strategic Architectural Imperatives

**-- STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURAL IMPERATIVE --**
**Imperative:** N/A
**Architectural Justification:** All previously identified critical architectural flaws and directives have been resolved in this audit cycle. No new systemic weaknesses requiring a strategic imperative were identified.
**Expected Impact:** N/A

## Part 3: Actionable Technical Debt Rectification

No new technical debt items were logged during this audit. Refer to `technical_debt.md` for the full list of items.
*   TD-20250601-002 (Overly Permissive `safe_float` Conversion) has been confirmed as ADDRESSED based on `docs/memory.md` and code verification.
*   Debug print statements in `src/meqsap/config.py` were identified and removed during this audit cycle, preventing the need to log them as new technical debt.

## Part 4: Audit Conclusion & Next Steps Mandate

 1.  **Critical Path to Compliance:**
    * All previously identified architectural flaws (FLAW-20250601-001 to -004, FLAW-20250602-001, and FLAW-20250602-002) are confirmed as RESOLVED. There are no outstanding critical path items from prior mandates.
 2.  **System Integrity Verdict:** The system's architectural integrity and adherence to prior mandates has **improved** significantly. All previously identified flaws are now resolved. There were no regressions or re-opened issues identified in this audit.
 3.  **`arch_review.md` Update Instruction:** Confirm that the output of Part 1A (unresolved, partially resolved, regressed issues) and relevant items from Part 1B (new flaws, including re-opened ones not immediately fixed) form the basis for the next `arch_review.md`.
    * All flaws listed in Part 1A of this document are confirmed RESOLVED.
    * There are no new critical flaws or unresolved directives from this audit cycle to carry forward. The next `arch_review.md` will primarily serve as a record of the resolutions achieved in this cycle.
4.  **`resolved_issues.md` Maintenance Confirmation:**
    * `resolved_issues.md` has been updated. Entries for FLAW-20250601-001, FLAW-20250601-002, FLAW-20250601-003, FLAW-20250601-004, and FLAW-20250602-002 have been updated to the standard detailed format, reflecting their resolution on 2025-06-02 with a Reopen Count of 0. The entry for FLAW-20250602-001 was already in the correct format and remains accurate.
    * The "Last Updated" date in `resolved_issues.md` has been set to 2025-06-03.
