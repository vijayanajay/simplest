# MEQSAP Architectural Review - 2025-06-11

This document outlines architectural directives, new critical flaws, and strategic imperatives identified during the audit.

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-11

## Part 1A: Compliance Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-001 (Local ConfigError in config.py)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Remains compliant. The canonical `ConfigurationError` from `src/meqsap/exceptions.py` is used correctly.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-002 (Doc misalignment for CLI exceptions)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Remains compliant. Documentation correctly reflects the CLI exception hierarchy.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-003 (Doc inaccuracy in architecture.md project structure)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   The issue described in the prior audit has been addressed. `docs/architecture.md` now correctly represents the `src/meqsap/cli/` as a package with its submodules, both in the text and the project structure diagram. The documentation is now aligned with the codebase.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250601-004 (Doc error in adr-002-date-range-handling.md validation logic)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Remains compliant. The validation logic example in the ADR is correct.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250602-001 (Incorrect Error Handling & Exit Code in CLI)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Remains compliant. The `handle_cli_errors` decorator correctly maps exceptions to exit codes.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** FLAW-20250602-002 (Default Pass for Data Coverage Check)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   Remains compliant. `get_required_data_coverage_bars` is an abstract method, and `perform_vibe_checks` correctly handles its absence.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

## Part 1B: New Critical Architectural Flaws

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE (from Part 1B of previous review) --**
**Directive Reference:** Critical Logic Failure (Type mismatch in `analyze` command call chain)
**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
   The root cause was identified as `run_complete_backtest` being called with inconsistent types for its `strategy_config` parameter (a `StrategyConfig` object from the CLI path, and a `dict` from the optimizer path). This has been resolved by refactoring the call chain to be consistent and robust. The `meqsap.optimizer.engine` now creates a temporary `StrategyConfig` object for each trial, injecting the trial's specific parameters. The `run_complete_backtest` and `generate_signals` functions were simplified to remove the now-redundant `concrete_params` argument, strengthening their API contract.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** N/A

## Part 2: Strategic Architectural Imperatives

N/A. No new systemic issues identified that require strategic imperatives.

## Part 3: Actionable Technical Debt Rectification

No new technical debt logged. All identified critical flaws were fixed.

## Part 4: Audit Conclusion & Next Steps Mandate

1.  **Critical Path to Compliance:** All identified issues from the previous audit cycle have been addressed and verified as resolved.
2.  **System Integrity Verdict:** **IMPROVED**. The critical regression bug has been fixed, and a minor documentation drift was resolved. The API contract between the optimizer and backtesting engine has been strengthened, improving overall system integrity.
3.  **`arch_review.md` Update Instruction:** This document serves as the updated `arch_review.md`. There are no outstanding unresolved issues to carry forward to the next audit cycle.
4.  **`resolved_issues.md` Maintenance Confirmation:** `resolved_issues.md` has been updated to log the resolution of FLAW-20250601-003 and the critical logic failure from the previous audit's Part 1B.
