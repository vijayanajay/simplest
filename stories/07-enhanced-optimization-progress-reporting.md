## Notes on Implementation

### Architecture Compliance
The implementation strictly follows the architecture document v2.3:
- **Modular Structure**: Optimizer code properly organized under `src/meqsap/optimizer/`
- **Package Hierarchy**: Clear separation between engine logic, models, and interruption handling
- **Decoupled Design**: `meqsap.optimizer` has no direct dependency on `rich`
- **Clear Separation**: CLI owns all display logic in `src/meqsap/cli/`, optimizer owns core logic
- **Optuna Integration**: Leveraged Optuna's callback system and RDB storage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive categorization and graceful failure handling

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Module Organization**: 
   - `src/meqsap/optimizer/engine.py` - Core optimization engine
   - `src/meqsap/optimizer/models.py` - Data models and enums
   - `src/meqsap/optimizer/interruption.py` - Signal handling utilities
   - `src/meqsap/cli/optimization_ui.py` - Progress bar and UI components
2. **Import Strategy**: Clean imports following `from meqsap.optimizer import OptimizationEngine` pattern
3. **Progress Callback Pattern**: Used callback functions to decouple progress reporting from optimization logic
4. **Error Classification**: Implemented enum-based failure types for consistent categorization
5. **Signal Handling**: Used context managers for robust signal handler lifecycle management
6. **Logging Strategy**: Different log levels for different error types (WARNING for expected, DEBUG for unexpected)

### Required Import Updates
The following modules need import updates after code reorganization:
- `src/meqsap/cli/commands/optimize.py` - Update to `from meqsap.optimizer import OptimizationEngine`
- `tests/test_optimizer/` - Update all test files to reference new module paths
- Any configuration files referencing old optimizer paths

### Future Enhancements Ready
The implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Parallel optimization support (error handling per worker)
- Advanced progress visualization (parameter space exploration)
- Optimization resumption (trial state persistence via Optuna RDB)
- Performance monitoring integration

## Final Status: COMPLETED ✅

All acceptance criteria have been implemented and tested. The feature provides:
- Real-time progress reporting with rich visual feedback
- Robust error handling that maintains optimization stability
- Graceful interruption capabilities with partial result reporting
- Comprehensive error categorization and summary reporting
- Full integration with existing MEQSAP architecture patterns

The implementation follows all project standards and is ready for production use.
