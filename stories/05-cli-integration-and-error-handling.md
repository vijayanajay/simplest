# Story: CLI Integration and Error Handling Enhancement

## Description
As the final component to complete the MEQSAP core pipeline, we need to enhance the CLI module with comprehensive error handling, user-friendly messaging, and robust command-line argument processing. This story focuses on creating a polished, production-ready command-line interface that integrates all previously developed modules (config, data, backtest, reporting) into a seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete CLI interface supports all required command-line flags (`--report`, `--verbose`, `--version`, etc.)
2. Comprehensive error handling provides clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
3. User-friendly output formatting with appropriate logging levels and colored console output
4. Robust configuration file validation with specific error messages for common mistakes
5. Data acquisition errors are handled gracefully with helpful troubleshooting suggestions
6. Backtest execution errors provide clear diagnostics and recovery suggestions
7. Version information displays tool version and key dependency versions
8. Progress indicators for long-running operations (data download, backtest execution)
9. Dry-run mode allows configuration validation without executing backtest
10. Exit codes follow standard conventions for integration with scripts and CI/CD

   * Validate that market data is compatible with the strategy requirements
   * Set up progress tracking for the multi-stage backtest execution process

2. **Generate Trading Signals with Progress Feedback**
   * Call the signal generation functions from the existing backtest module
   * Display progress for indicator calculation and signal generation stages
   * Validate that signals were generated successfully and contain expected entry/exit points

3. **Execute Core Backtest Computation**
   * Run the vectorbt portfolio simulation using the generated signals
   * Display progress for the backtest computation including memory usage for large datasets
   * Capture timing information for performance analysis and optimization

4. **Perform Validation and Robustness Checks**
   * Execute all vibe checks using the existing perform_vibe_checks function
   * Run robustness analysis using the existing perform_robustness_checks function
   * Display progress for each validation check with clear pass/fail indicators

5. **Handle Computation Errors with Specific Diagnostics**
   * Catch computation errors and provide specific diagnostic information
   * Include suggestions for resolving common issues like insufficient data or invalid parameters
   * Provide detailed error context including strategy parameters and data characteristics

### Output Generation Coordinator Function

**Component:** `CLI Module`
**Function:** `generate_output`

**Inputs:**
* BacktestResult object containing all performance metrics and statistics
* VibeCheckResults object with validation check outcomes
* RobustnessResults object with robustness analysis results
* StrategyConfig object with strategy parameters for context
* Boolean flags for report generation, quiet mode, and output directory preference

**Output:**
* None (side effects: terminal output display and optional PDF file generation)
* Raises ReportGenerationError for any output or file system failures

**Steps:**
1. **Generate Terminal Output**
   * Call the existing reporting module's generate_executive_verdict function
   * Ensure output formatting adapts to current terminal width and capabilities
   * Add timestamps and execution metadata to provide context for the analysis results

2. **Handle PDF Report Generation (if requested)**
   * If report flag is set, call the existing reporting module's generate_pdf_report function
   * Display progress for PDF generation including pyfolio tear sheet creation stages
   * Handle file system errors including permissions, disk space, and path validation issues

3. **Manage Output Directory Operations**
   * Create custom output directories if specified and they don't exist
   * Implement default output directory handling with appropriate fallback locations
   * Validate directory permissions and available disk space before attempting file operations

4. **Provide Operation Success Feedback**
   * Display clear success messages with summaries of what was accomplished
   * Include exact file paths for any generated reports or output files
   * Provide timing and performance summaries for the complete pipeline execution

5. **Handle File System Errors Gracefully**
   * Catch and handle permission errors with specific suggestions for resolution
   * Manage disk space issues with clear error messages and suggested actions
   * Ensure partial operations are cleaned up properly if errors occur during output generation

### Version Information Display Function

**Component:** `CLI Module`
**Function:** `display_version_info`

**Inputs:**
* None (accesses package metadata and system information)

**Output:**
* Formatted version information displayed to terminal
* Side effect: program exits with code 0 after displaying information

**Steps:**
1. **Gather MEQSAP Version Information**
   * Retrieve MEQSAP version from package metadata using importlib.metadata
   * Include build information and installation details for troubleshooting
   * Format version information in a clear, readable structure

2. **Collect Critical Dependency Versions**
   * Gather versions of key dependencies including vectorbt, pandas, yfinance, rich, and pyfolio
   * Include Python version and platform information for compatibility diagnostics
   * Check for known compatibility issues and display warnings if found

3. **Format and Display Version Information**
   * Create a formatted table using rich library showing all version information
   * Include system information relevant for debugging and support
   * Display installation method and location information when available

4. **Exit Application Cleanly**
   * Exit the application with code 0 after displaying version information
   * Ensure no other pipeline operations are executed when version flag is used
   * Clean up any resources that may have been initialized during startup

### Error Recovery Suggestion Function

**Component:** `CLI Module`
**Function:** `generate_recovery_suggestions`

**Inputs:**
* Error category (configuration, data, computation, filesystem)
* Specific error details and context information
* Current system state and operation context

**Output:**
* List of specific, actionable recovery suggestions for the user

**Steps:**
1. **Analyze Error Context**
   * Examine the specific error type and failure mode
   * Consider the current operation context and system state
   * Identify the most likely causes based on error patterns

2. **Generate Targeted Suggestions**
   * Provide specific steps based on the error category and context
   * Include examples of corrected configuration files for configuration errors
   * Suggest alternative approaches when the primary method fails

3. **Include Documentation References**
   * Reference relevant sections of documentation or troubleshooting guides
   * Provide links to examples and tutorials when appropriate
   * Include community resources and support channels for complex issues

4. **Prioritize Suggestions by Likelihood**
   * Order suggestions from most likely to resolve the issue to least likely
   * Include quick fixes first, followed by more comprehensive solutions
   * Indicate which suggestions require external dependencies or system changes

5. **Provide Follow-up Guidance**
   * Include steps for verifying that suggested fixes resolved the issue
   * Provide guidance on what to do if suggested solutions don't work
   * Include information for reporting bugs or seeking additional help
