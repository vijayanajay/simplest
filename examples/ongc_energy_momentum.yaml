# ENERGY SECTOR MOMENTUM PARAMETERS
# ---------------------------------
# Parameters optimized for oil & gas sector characteristics
# Energy stocks show strong correlation with crude oil prices and global cycles

strategy_params:
  # Responsive fast MA for commodity price correlation
  # Energy stocks react quickly to crude oil price movements
  fast_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [5, 8, 12, 15, 20]    # Short to medium-term momentum periods
  
  # Trend confirmation for energy cycle timing
  # Oil cycles can last 2-5 years, requiring longer confirmation
  slow_ma:
    type: "range"
    start: 30      # Short-term energy cycles
    stop: 120      # Long-term energy cycles (exclusive)
    step: 15       # Test: 30,45,60,75,90,105

# TOTAL RETURN OPTIMIZATION
# -------------------------
# Energy sector momentum strategies focus on capturing major moves
# Commodity-linked stocks can have explosive upside during super-cycles

# ENERGY SECTOR DYNAMICS
# ----------------------
# 1. Crude Oil Price Correlation: 70-80% correlation with Brent/WTI prices
# 2. Global Demand Cycles: Economic growth drives energy consumption
# 3. Geopolitical Risk Premium: Middle East tensions, sanctions impact
# 4. OPEC Production Decisions: Supply cuts/increases affect prices
# 5. Currency Impact: USD strength affects oil prices and costs
# 6. Refining Margins: GRM (Gross Refining Margin) drives profitability
# 7. Government Policy: Subsidy burden, pricing freedom
# 8. Energy Transition: Long-term shift to renewables
#
# COMMODITY MOMENTUM CHARACTERISTICS:
# ----------------------------------
# Energy Sector Trading Patterns:
# - Strong trending behavior during oil bull/bear markets
# - Mean reversion during sideways oil price consolidation
# - Gap movements on geopolitical events
# - Seasonal patterns (driving season, winter heating)
# - Inventory data impacts (weekly EIA reports)
#
# Momentum Strategy Rationale:
# - Energy super-cycles can last multiple years
# - Strong trends justify momentum-based approaches
# - Commodity volatility requires responsive parameters
# - Total return focus captures major cyclical moves
#
# ONGC SPECIFIC FACTORS
# ---------------------
# Business Characteristics:
# - Upstream focus: Oil & gas exploration and production
# - Government ownership: ~60% government stake
# - Dividend policy: Attractive dividend yield during profitable periods
# - Exploration assets: Domestic and international operations
# - Refining exposure: Limited downstream integration
#
# Key Performance Drivers:
# - Crude oil realization prices
# - Natural gas pricing reforms
# - Exploration success rates
# - Government policy on energy pricing
# - Capital allocation to new projects vs dividends
#
# OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY ANALYSIS
# ------------------------------
# Parameter Space: 5 fast_ma x 6 slow_ma = 30 combinations
#
# Expected Performance Patterns:
# Fast MA Analysis:
# - 5-day: Captures daily oil price movements, higher noise
# - 8-12 day: Balances responsiveness with noise reduction
# - 15-20 day: Medium-term momentum, misses some quick reversals
#
# Slow MA Analysis:
# - 30-45 day: Short-term energy cycles, quarterly patterns
# - 60-75 day: Medium-term trends, seasonal adjustments
# - 90-105 day: Long-term energy cycles, major trend changes
#
# COMMODITY CYCLE CONSIDERATIONS
# ------------------------------
# Historical Energy Cycles:
# - Oil Bull Market 2021-2022: Post-COVID demand recovery
# - Oil Bear Market 2014-2016: Shale oil supply surge
# - Oil Super-cycle 2003-2008: China demand growth
# - Oil Crash 2020: COVID demand destruction
#
# Strategy Performance Expectations:
# - Bull Markets: Momentum strategies outperform significantly
# - Bear Markets: Early exit signals preserve capital
# - Sideways Markets: Higher transaction costs, lower returns
# - Volatility Spikes: Responsive parameters capture moves
#
# RISK MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
# ------------------------------
# Energy Sector Risks:
# - High volatility (daily moves of 5-10% common)
# - Gap risk on geopolitical events
# - Currency exposure through oil price impacts
# - Regulatory changes in energy policy
# - Long-term transition risks (renewable energy shift)
#
# Position Sizing Guidelines:
# - Reduce position size during high volatility periods
# - Consider oil price technical levels for entry/exit
# - Monitor global economic indicators (PMI, GDP growth)
# - Track inventory levels and production decisions
#
# USAGE EXAMPLES
# --------------
# 1. Energy momentum optimization:
#    python run.py optimize single examples/ongc_energy_momentum.yaml --report --verbose
#
# 2. Quick cycle analysis:
#    python run.py optimize single examples/ongc_energy_momentum.yaml --no-progress
