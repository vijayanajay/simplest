# BANKING SECTOR OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------
# Parameter ranges specifically tuned for Indian banking sector characteristics
# Based on sector volatility patterns and regulatory cycle timing

strategy_params:
  # Banking-optimized fast MA range
  # Banks show strong momentum patterns during policy cycles
  fast_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [10, 15, 20, 25]     # Popular banking sector momentum periods
  
  # Long-term trend confirmation for banking cycles
  # Banking stocks benefit from longer trend confirmation due to:
  # - Interest rate cycle impacts (6-18 month cycles)
  # - Credit cycle timing (12-24 month patterns)
  # - Regulatory announcement effects
  slow_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [50, 75, 100, 150]   # Banking-specific trend periods

# PROFIT FACTOR OPTIMIZATION
# --------------------------
# Optimize for trade quality rather than pure returns
# Banking sector benefits from high-quality trade selection

optimization_config:
  active: true
  algorithm: "GridSearch"          # Systematic exploration of all combinations
  objective_function: "profit_factor"  # Gross profit / Gross loss ratio
  objective_params:
    min_trades: 5                # Minimum trades required for valid results
  cache_results: true

# PUBLIC SECTOR BANKING CHARACTERISTICS
# ------------------------------------
# 1. Government Policy Sensitivity: Budget announcements, policy changes
# 2. Credit Quality Cycles: NPL recognition and resolution cycles
# 3. Interest Rate Sensitivity: More sensitive than private banks
# 4. Dividend Policy: Government dividend requirements affect capital
# 5. Digital Transformation: Ongoing technology modernization initiatives
# 6. Rural Penetration: Significant rural and semi-urban presence
# 7. Corporate Lending Focus: Large corporate and infrastructure lending
# 8. Regulatory Compliance: Stricter oversight than private banks
#
# PROFIT FACTOR OPTIMIZATION RATIONALE:
# ------------------------------------
# - Banking stocks can have extended drawdown periods
# - Quality of trades more important than frequency
# - Profit factor helps identify parameters that avoid false signals
# - Banking sector momentum tends to be sustained when genuine
# - Reduces whipsaw trades during sideways consolidation periods
#
# PARAMETER ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
# ----------------------------
# Total Combinations: 4 x 4 = 16 parameter sets (manageable for detailed analysis)
#
# Expected Parameter Performance:
# - Fast MA 10-15: Captures policy-driven moves quickly
# - Fast MA 20-25: Reduces noise, misses some quick reversals
# - Slow MA 50-75: Good for quarterly result cycles
# - Slow MA 100-150: Captures major credit/policy cycles
#
# SECTOR ROTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
# ------------------------------
# - Banking outperforms during rising rate cycles
# - Underperforms during rate cut cycles and recession fears
# - Credit growth cycles drive medium-term performance
# - Monsoon impact on rural lending affects seasonal performance
# - Budget announcements create volatility (typically January-February)
#
# RISK MANAGEMENT NOTES:
# ---------------------
# - Banking stocks can gap down on credit quality concerns
# - Regulatory announcements can cause sudden moves
# - Results seasons show high volatility (quarterly)
# - Consider position sizing based on sector allocation limits
# - Monitor macro indicators: inflation, GDP growth, policy rates
#
