# Strategy parameters can now be defined as fixed values,
# ranges, choices, or explicit single values within a structure.
# This prepares the strategy for future automated optimization.
# For a single backtest run (without optimization), the system
# will use default logic (e.g., first choice, start of range)
# or an explicitly defined 'value' type.

strategy_params:
  # Example 1: Fast MA as a range, Slow MA as a fixed value
  # fast_ma:
  #   type: "range"
  #   start: 5
  #   stop: 15
  #   step: 1
  # slow_ma: 30 # Fixed value, backward compatible

  # Example 2: Both MAs as choices
  fast_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [10, 12, 15]
  slow_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [30, 40, 50]

  # Note: The validator `slow_ma > fast_ma` still applies.
  # If using ranges/choices, this validation might be more complex
  # or deferred until concrete values are selected for a run.
  # For a single run, if fast_ma=15 (from choices) and slow_ma=30 (from choices), it's valid.
