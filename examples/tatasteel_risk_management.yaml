# STEEL SECTOR RISK-FOCUSED PARAMETERS
# ------------------------------------
# Conservative parameter ranges designed for volatile cyclical sector
# Steel stocks show extreme volatility due to commodity price swings

strategy_params:
  # Conservative fast MA range to reduce whipsaw trades
  # Steel sector has high intraday volatility requiring noise filtering
  fast_ma:
    type: "range"  
    start: 15      # Minimum to filter daily noise
    stop: 40       # Medium-term momentum (exclusive)
    step: 3        # Test: 15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39
  
  # Long-term trend confirmation for cyclical sector
  # Steel cycles are multi-year, requiring longer confirmation periods
  slow_ma:
    type: "choices"
    values: [60, 100, 150, 200]  # Extended periods for cyclical confirmation

# MAXIMUM DRAWDOWN MINIMIZATION
# -----------------------------
# Optimize to minimize maximum drawdown rather than maximize returns
# Critical for steel sector due to extreme volatility and cyclical nature

optimization_config:
  active: true
  algorithm: "GridSearch"           # Systematic search for risk-optimal parameters
  objective_function: "CalmarRatio"  # Maximize return relative to drawdown
  objective_params:
     min_trades: 5                  # Minimum trades for valid risk assessment
  cache_results: true

# STEEL SECTOR RISK CHARACTERISTICS
# ---------------------------------
# 1. Commodity Price Volatility: Iron ore, coking coal price swings
# 2. Global Demand Cycles: Chinese demand, global infrastructure spending
# 3. Currency Impact: Import costs vs export competitiveness
# 4. Environmental Regulations: Carbon emission norms, green steel transition
# 5. Capacity Utilization Cycles: Oversupply/undersupply periods
# 6. Trade Policy Sensitivity: Import duties, anti-dumping measures
# 7. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Capital intensive industry
# 8. Infrastructure Spending: Government capex drives domestic demand
#
# HIGH VOLATILITY RISK FACTORS:
# -----------------------------
# Historical Drawdown Events:
# - COVID-19 Impact (Mar 2020): -70% drawdown in weeks
# - China Demand Shock (2015-16): Extended bear market
# - Global Financial Crisis (2008): Severe cyclical downturn
# - Trade War Periods: Export uncertainty creates volatility
#
# Risk Management Rationale:
# - Steel stocks can lose 50%+ value in bear cycles
# - Drawdown minimization preserves capital for next cycle
# - Reduces emotional stress during volatile periods
# - Enables consistent position sizing across cycles
#
# CYCLICAL SECTOR STRATEGY:
# ------------------------
# Parameter Selection Philosophy:
# - Longer MAs reduce false signals during consolidation
# - Conservative parameters miss some upside but avoid major drawdowns
# - Steel sector momentum tends to be sustained when genuine
# - Exit signals more important than entry timing
#
# Expected Parameter Performance:
# - Fast MA 15-21: Quick response but higher risk
# - Fast MA 24-30: Balanced approach for most conditions
# - Fast MA 33-39: Conservative, may miss short cycles
# - Slow MA 60-100: Captures major cyclical turns
# - Slow MA 150-200: Ultra-conservative for multi-year cycles
#
# RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE METRICS:
# ----------------------------------
# Key Metrics to Monitor:
# - Maximum Drawdown: Primary optimization target
# - Drawdown Duration: Time to recover from losses
# - Calmar Ratio: Annual return / Maximum drawdown
# - Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted returns
# - Sortino Ratio: Downside deviation adjusted returns
#
# TATA STEEL SPECIFIC FACTORS:
# ----------------------------
# - Integrated steel producer with iron ore mines
# - European operations provide geographic diversification
# - Debt levels amplify volatility during down cycles
# - Government policy on mining rights affects long-term outlook
# - Green steel initiatives require significant capex
# - Consolidation opportunities in fragmented Indian market
#
# USAGE EXAMPLES:
# --------------
# 1. Drawdown minimization optimization:
#    python run.py optimize single examples/tatasteel_risk_management.yaml --report --verbose
#
# 2. Risk analysis with detailed reporting:
#    python run.py optimize single examples/tatasteel_risk_management.yaml --report --output-dir ./steel_risk_analysis
#
# 3. Compare with return optimization:
#    # Create copy with objective_function: "total_return" for comparison
#    python run.py optimize single examples/tatasteel_risk_management.yaml --verbose
#
# PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT:
# --------------------------
# Integration Guidelines:
# - Use optimized parameters as base for position sizing rules
# - Implement stop-loss levels based on historical drawdown analysis
# - Consider sector rotation signals for cyclical timing
# - Monitor commodity price indicators for early warning signals
# - Diversify across steel value chain (miners, producers, users)
#
# STRESS TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
# ------------------------------
# - Test parameters across different commodity cycles
# - Validate during high volatility periods (2020, 2008)
# - Check performance during sector rotation events
# - Analyze sensitivity to global growth slowdowns
# - Monitor correlation with broader market during stress periods
